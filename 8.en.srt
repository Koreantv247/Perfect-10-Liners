1
00:00:00,405 --> 00:00:01,312
Sometimes,

2
00:00:01,859 --> 00:00:03,588
a chance might not come often.

3
00:00:03,931 --> 00:00:05,420
But if you finally got one,

4
00:00:06,253 --> 00:00:07,420
hold it tightly.

5
00:00:08,432 --> 00:00:10,176
And attentively take good care of it.

6
00:00:11,480 --> 00:00:12,324
Um, I forgot.

7
00:00:12,571 --> 00:00:13,917
I’m just ordinary.

8
00:00:14,597 --> 00:00:15,524
You’re so good at it.

9
00:00:15,914 --> 00:00:16,552
Good at what?

10
00:00:17,068 --> 00:00:18,708
Messing with my feelings. You’re really good at it.

11
00:00:19,800 --> 00:00:21,065
But right now, from the way I look at you,

12
00:00:21,912 --> 00:00:23,124
don’t you feel anything at all?

13
00:00:25,428 --> 00:00:26,216
You're really something,

14
00:00:26,887 --> 00:00:28,665
making me brave enough to open up again.

15
00:00:32,148 --> 00:00:33,167
Here you are, Tongfah.

16
00:00:34,320 --> 00:00:36,035
Take it as my apology gift

17
00:00:36,234 --> 00:00:38,223
for being such a bad buddy.

18
00:00:40,281 --> 00:00:42,314
It’s fun to have you as my buddy though.

19
00:00:42,605 --> 00:00:43,324
Oh, man.

20
00:00:43,838 --> 00:00:45,115
Which part of this was fun?

21
00:00:45,869 --> 00:00:47,608
I didn’t do anything for you.

22
00:00:51,447 --> 00:00:52,706
Nice to meet you.

23
00:01:07,238 --> 00:01:08,011
We can hug.

24
00:01:09,493 --> 00:01:10,881
We already talked.

25
00:01:11,780 --> 00:01:12,528
Talked?

26
00:01:13,327 --> 00:01:13,845
Um.

27
00:01:18,937 --> 00:01:20,425
You don’t have any feelings for Arm, do you?

28
00:01:21,265 --> 00:01:24,573
Do the liners here get involved in
each other's personal stuff this much?

29
00:01:24,613 --> 00:01:25,700
We’re sure just the liners now.

30
00:01:27,054 --> 00:01:28,117
But maybe not in the future.

31
00:01:31,229 --> 00:01:33,105
Why do you have such a serious face?

32
00:01:33,530 --> 00:01:34,573
But it’s understandable.

33
00:01:35,269 --> 00:01:36,703
Arm is that cute.

34
00:01:37,208 --> 00:01:37,733
Hey.

35
00:01:38,410 --> 00:01:39,582
Don’t mess with Arm.

36
00:01:40,936 --> 00:01:42,502
What did I do to make you think of me that way?

37
00:01:43,521 --> 00:01:44,500
You're the only one

38
00:01:45,173 --> 00:01:46,567
being so possessive for no reason.

39
00:01:47,891 --> 00:01:50,976
Also, you don’t have to worry
that Arm will fall for others.

40
00:01:51,730 --> 00:01:53,608
I think he likes you

41
00:01:55,167 --> 00:01:56,657
even more than how much you like him.

42
00:02:05,072 --> 00:02:06,383
Did he talk like that?

43
00:02:08,321 --> 00:02:10,515
But I told him I’m already seeing someone.

44
00:02:10,920 --> 00:02:11,521
Huh?

45
00:02:13,081 --> 00:02:14,302
Really, you are?

46
00:02:14,656 --> 00:02:15,217
Um.

47
00:02:17,548 --> 00:02:18,462
So, can we hug now?

48
00:02:21,060 --> 00:02:22,179
Nice to meet you.

49
00:02:25,072 --> 00:02:27,980
By the way, who’s your date?

50
00:02:28,198 --> 00:02:28,934
Is your date here?

51
00:02:29,337 --> 00:02:30,807
Nah, my bae studies medicine.

52
00:02:31,140 --> 00:02:32,005
Not gonna be free.

53
00:02:32,263 --> 00:02:34,546
Whoa, studying medicine?

54
00:02:34,825 --> 00:02:35,349
Um.

55
00:02:35,653 --> 00:02:36,628
So cool.

56
00:02:37,063 --> 00:02:38,607
But my bae studies at the same uni.

57
00:02:39,440 --> 00:02:41,509
If you come to Chiangmai, tell me.

58
00:02:42,330 --> 00:02:44,508
I’ll take you on a trip – all free.

59
00:02:45,219 --> 00:02:48,251
Okay, I love freebies.

60
00:02:50,722 --> 00:02:52,022
I’m going. See you.

61
00:02:52,248 --> 00:02:52,848
Bye.

62
00:03:03,749 --> 00:03:05,660
Thank you, Arc.

63
00:03:08,534 --> 00:03:09,229
I’m sorry.

64
00:03:10,710 --> 00:03:11,958
Sometimes I might say things the wrong way.

65
00:03:12,899 --> 00:03:13,786
But I never mean any harm.

66
00:03:15,854 --> 00:03:17,321
Arm must order you to do this.

67
00:03:18,133 --> 00:03:18,743
How can you know?

68
00:03:18,933 --> 00:03:21,825
Well, though I just met everyone,

69
00:03:21,866 --> 00:03:23,417
I can see that Arm is a nice person.

70
00:03:26,074 --> 00:03:28,005
Since you've got someone
so good right in front of you,

71
00:03:28,342 --> 00:03:29,774
you better take care of it, okay?

72
00:03:31,722 --> 00:03:34,005
How can you know so well
after being here for a few days?

73
00:03:35,272 --> 00:03:35,974
A-ngun told me.

74
00:03:38,014 --> 00:03:39,607
Looking forward to hearing the next update.

75
00:03:41,865 --> 00:03:43,072
They're such a perfect match.

76
00:03:43,515 --> 00:03:45,389
The Beyond-the-star and the campus star.

77
00:03:45,522 --> 00:03:46,608
Absolutely top-tier.

78
00:03:46,908 --> 00:03:49,010
Exactly! I’m rooting for this couple too.

79
00:03:49,859 --> 00:03:51,380
But that whole lineage couple thing?

80
00:03:51,630 --> 00:03:54,511
It’s kinda repetitive after Jet and Yeepun.

81
00:03:54,922 --> 00:03:55,970
Inter-university love?

82
00:03:56,128 --> 00:03:56,957
Now that’s a fresh plot.

83
00:03:57,114 --> 00:03:57,909
Sounds way more exciting.

84
00:03:58,008 --> 00:03:58,908
- Exactly.
- I know, right?

85
00:04:00,804 --> 00:04:01,354
So cute.

86
00:04:04,525 --> 00:04:05,265
Wait, Brink.

87
00:04:05,604 --> 00:04:06,277
Stop there.

88
00:04:07,962 --> 00:04:09,508
Thought you wouldn’t come to send me off.

89
00:04:10,225 --> 00:04:11,411
How could I?

90
00:04:11,982 --> 00:04:12,480
Hmm?

91
00:04:12,647 --> 00:04:13,377
Whoa.

92
00:04:13,992 --> 00:04:15,355
I went to buy a gift.

93
00:04:15,690 --> 00:04:16,977
Almost didn’t make it on time.

94
00:04:17,622 --> 00:04:18,121
Here.

95
00:04:18,228 --> 00:04:19,182
Thanks.

96
00:04:20,478 --> 00:04:21,339
See you again.

97
00:04:23,029 --> 00:04:23,680
Let’s hug.

98
00:04:29,272 --> 00:04:29,865
I’m leaving.

99
00:04:30,448 --> 00:04:31,217
- Bye.
- See you.

100
00:04:35,370 --> 00:04:35,903
Bye bye.

101
00:06:22,995 --> 00:06:23,838
Have you noticed it?

102
00:06:23,859 --> 00:06:25,237
When we’re back,

103
00:06:25,671 --> 00:06:27,817
all of us always keep sighing.

104
00:06:27,971 --> 00:06:28,779
Sigh.

105
00:06:29,120 --> 00:06:29,730
That’s enough.

106
00:06:33,678 --> 00:06:35,470
Hey, what’s wrong?

107
00:06:35,915 --> 00:06:36,823
Been all sullen since the morning.

108
00:06:36,960 --> 00:06:38,703
Nothing, I’m fine.

109
00:06:39,540 --> 00:06:40,834
Not you, dude.

110
00:06:41,029 --> 00:06:41,814
I’m talking about him.

111
00:06:44,208 --> 00:06:45,505
It’s you. What’s wrong?

112
00:06:46,727 --> 00:06:47,340
Nothing.

113
00:06:48,589 --> 00:06:50,971
I’m alright, just tired.

114
00:06:51,229 --> 00:06:52,165
Was in the sun all day.

115
00:06:56,983 --> 00:06:57,622
You sure?

116
00:06:58,450 --> 00:06:58,946
Yeah.

117
00:07:00,084 --> 00:07:00,648
Well.

118
00:07:01,020 --> 00:07:05,010
You didn’t see the hashtag of
the campus stars and got upset, did you?

119
00:07:06,785 --> 00:07:07,505
Oh, Po.

120
00:07:08,016 --> 00:07:09,102
What do you take me for?

121
00:07:09,517 --> 00:07:11,715
I’m not gonna waste my time
thinking about that nonsense.

122
00:07:12,188 --> 00:07:12,715
Bruh.

123
00:07:12,970 --> 00:07:13,823
Good that you’re alright.

124
00:07:16,376 --> 00:07:19,269
Then, Po, quick.

125
00:07:19,899 --> 00:07:20,377
What’s that?

126
00:07:20,666 --> 00:07:21,814
Let’s do our group work.

127
00:07:22,333 --> 00:07:23,211
What group work?

128
00:07:23,240 --> 00:07:24,874
You’re in the same group as me.

129
00:07:24,880 --> 00:07:25,770
SO HANDSOME :) / MY NAME IS BALL. / TELL ME ABOUT HIM $%&*))^&()

130
00:07:25,770 --> 00:07:27,090
What’s that?
SO HANDSOME :) / MY NAME IS BALL. / TELL ME ABOUT HIM $%&*))^&()

131
00:07:27,120 --> 00:07:28,078
Just do it.

132
00:07:29,005 --> 00:07:30,106
It’s a Cal work.

133
00:07:30,204 --> 00:07:31,004
Calorie?

134
00:07:31,680 --> 00:07:34,601
Maybe Calculator? Jerk, it’s Calculus.

135
00:07:34,672 --> 00:07:35,306
Oh.

136
00:07:37,811 --> 00:07:38,377
What’s up?

137
00:07:38,825 --> 00:07:39,582
(Are you at the dorm?)

138
00:07:40,360 --> 00:07:40,927
AM:		(Yeah.)

139
00:07:41,357 --> 00:07:42,274
Then why didn’t you tell me?

140
00:07:43,962 --> 00:07:44,619
I forgot.

141
00:07:46,371 --> 00:07:48,315
Hey, did you like my photo?

142
00:07:48,634 --> 00:07:51,075
(Why do I have to like your photo?)

143
00:07:52,093 --> 00:07:53,109
‘Cause I posted it for you.

144
00:07:53,521 --> 00:07:55,109
Posted it for me or somebody?

145
00:07:55,619 --> 00:07:56,674
(Yeah, you’re handsome.)

146
00:07:56,687 --> 00:07:58,112
(The most handsome one.)

147
00:07:58,728 --> 00:07:59,614
What a nosey.

148
00:08:00,099 --> 00:08:01,170
I’m not.

149
00:08:01,948 --> 00:08:03,420
Just happened to see it.

150
00:08:05,188 --> 00:08:06,108
Oh, right. Arc.

151
00:08:06,851 --> 00:08:07,377
(What?)

152
00:08:09,650 --> 00:08:10,577
Let me ask you something.

153
00:08:12,213 --> 00:08:14,576
Brink is both pretty and talented…

154
00:08:14,988 --> 00:08:17,475
Let’s talk openly, okay?

155
00:08:18,790 --> 00:08:19,974
Have you ever slipped up and caught feelings?

156
00:08:21,072 --> 00:08:22,402
Hey, Arm.

157
00:08:22,912 --> 00:08:23,315
(Well.)

158
00:08:23,530 --> 00:08:25,103
If I was praised like that,

159
00:08:25,334 --> 00:08:26,257
I’d love that person so much.

160
00:08:29,106 --> 00:08:29,912
Would love the person so much?

161
00:08:31,130 --> 00:08:31,802
(Of course.)

162
00:08:35,487 --> 00:08:36,373
The heck.

163
00:08:39,920 --> 00:08:43,890
SO HANDSOME. / SUPER CUTE.

164
00:08:46,880 --> 00:08:48,450
SO HANDSOME, ARM.

165
00:08:48,480 --> 00:08:50,090
THE CUTEST ONE.

166
00:08:50,487 --> 00:08:51,324
Arc, you bastard.

167
00:09:13,520 --> 00:09:16,290
I DON’T LIKE THIS PHOTO.

168
00:09:21,880 --> 00:09:23,210
WHAT’S THE PROBLEM?

169
00:09:23,240 --> 00:09:25,930
OR ARE YOU BEING POSSESSIVE AGAIN?

170
00:09:26,040 --> 00:09:27,690
ARM LOOKS CUTE HERE THOUGH.

171
00:09:29,440 --> 00:09:32,330
HE’S REALLY CUTE BUT I DON’T LIKE IT.

172
00:09:32,360 --> 00:09:35,250
DELETE THAT PHOTO AND POST THIS INSTEAD.

173
00:09:44,257 --> 00:09:44,823
You.

174
00:09:45,274 --> 00:09:46,257
What’s wrong, Pun? What’s wrong?

175
00:09:46,441 --> 00:09:47,081
Look at this.

176
00:09:47,854 --> 00:09:49,648
A couple photo of Arc-Arm.

177
00:09:51,525 --> 00:09:53,574
Are you the admin of
the Engineer Cute Boy’s page?

178
00:10:08,408 --> 00:10:09,014
Let’s eat.

179
00:10:16,540 --> 00:10:17,217
Hey, Arm.

180
00:10:17,702 --> 00:10:18,214
Hmm?

181
00:10:18,557 --> 00:10:21,771
Don’t you plan to tell Arc
that you’re an admin of this page?

182
00:10:24,262 --> 00:10:24,911
No idea.

183
00:10:25,927 --> 00:10:27,005
I don’t know how to tell him.

184
00:10:28,308 --> 00:10:29,004
Just don’t mind it.

185
00:10:29,860 --> 00:10:33,428
I think I’ll talk to Pun that I won’t do it anymore.

186
00:10:33,629 --> 00:10:34,909
I think if Arc knew that

187
00:10:35,282 --> 00:10:38,005
you saw those messages
where he was all lovey-dovey with you,

188
00:10:38,905 --> 00:10:40,414
he'd probably get super embarrassed.

189
00:10:41,420 --> 00:10:42,414
Super embarrassed, indeed.

190
00:10:44,075 --> 00:10:44,816
Oh, oh.

191
00:10:44,877 --> 00:10:45,530
Oh?

192
00:10:45,964 --> 00:10:46,570
All shy?

193
00:10:47,456 --> 00:10:48,681
Look, he’s hiding under the blanket.

194
00:10:49,019 --> 00:10:51,592
I don’t know if Arc would be
super embarrassed or not.

195
00:10:51,948 --> 00:10:52,811
But one thing is for sure,

196
00:10:53,137 --> 00:10:56,173
Arm, your friend, is now 3 centimeters tall.

197
00:10:57,974 --> 00:10:58,508
You jerk.

198
00:10:59,162 --> 00:11:01,007
Oh, what a shy baby.

199
00:11:01,404 --> 00:11:02,811
It’s quite extraordinary.

200
00:11:03,269 --> 00:11:07,567
The first couple photo of
the beyond the star on this page.

201
00:11:07,870 --> 00:11:11,202
It’s a photo with his beloved peer mentee.

202
00:11:11,391 --> 00:11:13,207
Whoa.

203
00:11:13,877 --> 00:11:15,588
Damn. Sleep already, you jerk.

204
00:11:15,600 --> 00:11:16,299
Too noisy.

205
00:11:16,512 --> 00:11:17,770
- Hey.
- Look at him.

206
00:11:17,917 --> 00:11:18,525
Let’s sleep.

207
00:11:18,555 --> 00:11:19,494
I’m sorry for the blanket.

208
00:11:19,976 --> 00:11:21,530
Po, you bastard. It’s hot.

209
00:11:21,592 --> 00:11:22,157
Let’s hug.

210
00:11:22,173 --> 00:11:22,770
Damn.

211
00:11:24,773 --> 00:11:26,182
Damn.

212
00:11:26,942 --> 00:11:28,262
I wanna die.

213
00:11:28,742 --> 00:11:31,368
Why am I getting stupider after studying?

214
00:11:31,598 --> 00:11:32,182
Exactly.

215
00:11:32,890 --> 00:11:35,269
Or should I drop out and mooch off my grandma?

216
00:11:35,856 --> 00:11:36,819
Oh, man.

217
00:11:37,051 --> 00:11:38,512
It’s just the beginning.

218
00:11:38,687 --> 00:11:39,951
The second year will be way tougher.

219
00:11:39,980 --> 00:11:42,454
Are you comforting Po or
just rushing to tell him to drop out?

220
00:11:43,376 --> 00:11:45,268
Look at you. I’m upset.

221
00:11:45,674 --> 00:11:46,620
I’ll drop out now.

222
00:11:53,705 --> 00:11:55,776
Well, you two don’t plan to stop me?

223
00:11:58,029 --> 00:11:59,477
Baby.

224
00:11:59,530 --> 00:12:00,970
- Po.
- You’ve changed.

225
00:12:00,988 --> 00:12:01,881
I’m kidding.

226
00:12:02,010 --> 00:12:03,610
You’ve changed.

227
00:12:04,520 --> 00:12:06,670
- Let’s stick together.
- Yeah, stay with us.

228
00:12:08,437 --> 00:12:09,013
Then,

229
00:12:09,540 --> 00:12:10,645
should we go party tonight?

230
00:12:12,174 --> 00:12:14,099
Well, I’m not free.

231
00:12:14,197 --> 00:12:16,016
I made an appointment with
Pond and others already.

232
00:12:19,388 --> 00:12:20,604
Then, what about you?

233
00:12:21,927 --> 00:12:22,702
This smile.

234
00:12:22,990 --> 00:12:24,195
I have an appointment with my liners.

235
00:12:24,219 --> 00:12:24,791
I see it’s coming.

236
00:12:24,822 --> 00:12:26,617
I cannot miss this one.

237
00:12:27,491 --> 00:12:29,198
It’s also Arc’s birthday party.

238
00:12:29,435 --> 00:12:30,410
Everyone will be there.

239
00:12:34,857 --> 00:12:36,514
You guys are so close.

240
00:12:36,805 --> 00:12:37,260
Yeah.

241
00:12:45,063 --> 00:12:46,853
Hey, but I love you the same, dude.

242
00:12:46,885 --> 00:12:48,380
Not the same, bro.

243
00:13:00,351 --> 00:13:00,912
Well,

244
00:13:01,860 --> 00:13:05,010
didn’t you tell me you invited everyone here?

245
00:13:05,420 --> 00:13:07,285
And, what is this?

246
00:13:07,309 --> 00:13:09,699
This is everyone in the Perfect 10 Liners.

247
00:13:10,164 --> 00:13:10,930
Only us.

248
00:13:12,549 --> 00:13:13,730
She’s just kidding.

249
00:13:15,263 --> 00:13:17,757
All the seniors graduated

250
00:13:18,140 --> 00:13:19,274
- so they don’t have much time.
- Okay.

251
00:13:20,075 --> 00:13:21,900
Hey, what about Tawan?

252
00:13:23,041 --> 00:13:23,998
Won’t Tawan come?

253
00:13:24,019 --> 00:13:25,315
Are you saying that

254
00:13:25,568 --> 00:13:29,142
Tawan is just floating around with no job?

255
00:13:29,278 --> 00:13:31,685
Hey, no, Yeepun. I didn’t mean it like that.

256
00:13:31,730 --> 00:13:35,502
I only know Tawan so I ask about him.

257
00:13:35,936 --> 00:13:37,201
Some said he’s living in the forest.

258
00:13:37,765 --> 00:13:39,385
Not sure if he’s out already.

259
00:13:39,939 --> 00:13:40,477
That’s right.

260
00:13:48,663 --> 00:13:51,078
Don’t you say you want to pee?

261
00:13:51,485 --> 00:13:52,503
You’ve said it for a while now,

262
00:13:52,517 --> 00:13:53,410
why don’t you go to the toilet already?

263
00:13:53,640 --> 00:13:54,395
I don’t.

264
00:13:54,740 --> 00:13:55,395
Not at all.

265
00:13:57,017 --> 00:13:57,757
You do.

266
00:13:58,401 --> 00:13:59,269
I don’t.

267
00:13:59,508 --> 00:14:00,180
You do.

268
00:14:02,768 --> 00:14:04,727
Just go already.

269
00:14:04,857 --> 00:14:06,497
Why do you hold back? It’s not good.

270
00:14:06,528 --> 00:14:07,376
I don’t want to pee.

271
00:14:08,371 --> 00:14:09,097
Will get kidney stones for sure.

272
00:14:14,130 --> 00:14:15,862
- Oh.
- Yeah.

273
00:14:16,391 --> 00:14:17,422
I do need to pee.

274
00:14:17,500 --> 00:14:18,934
- Exactly.
- Need to pee.

275
00:14:19,137 --> 00:14:20,542
I need to pee, yes.

276
00:14:20,995 --> 00:14:21,813
I need to pee.

277
00:14:22,216 --> 00:14:23,160
I need to pee.

278
00:14:23,185 --> 00:14:23,795
Yeah.

279
00:14:23,813 --> 00:14:24,977
Oh, I need to pee.

280
00:14:25,290 --> 00:14:26,322
I’ll go to the toilet for a moment.

281
00:14:26,520 --> 00:14:27,274
Just a moment.

282
00:14:27,299 --> 00:14:28,118
Hey, Arc.

283
00:14:28,637 --> 00:14:30,275
- Let’s make a toast.
- Come on. Make a toast.

284
00:14:51,800 --> 00:14:54,410
H.B.D. ARC.
WISH YOU ALL THE HAPPINESS.

285
00:15:11,309 --> 00:15:11,930
Hey.

286
00:15:13,222 --> 00:15:14,362
Make a wish first.

287
00:15:14,678 --> 00:15:15,736
You haven’t done it yet.

288
00:15:16,186 --> 00:15:16,669
Hey,

289
00:15:17,240 --> 00:15:19,205
how can you know my wish will come true?

290
00:15:19,299 --> 00:15:21,004
Huh? Have to talk to God?

291
00:15:21,315 --> 00:15:21,927
Sigh.

292
00:15:22,552 --> 00:15:23,970
If you don't believe it, don't disrespect it.

293
00:15:24,109 --> 00:15:24,762
Give me your hands.

294
00:15:25,188 --> 00:15:25,817
Hold them together.

295
00:15:26,721 --> 00:15:27,973
Make a wish first.

296
00:15:29,337 --> 00:15:29,903
Fine.

297
00:15:31,782 --> 00:15:33,371
I wish

298
00:15:37,263 --> 00:15:38,148
Arm will be my boyfriend.

299
00:15:38,411 --> 00:15:38,912
Oh.

300
00:15:41,090 --> 00:15:44,508
♪ You’re the love suspect, hard to crack ♪

301
00:15:45,110 --> 00:15:49,408
Can this one come true, God?
♪ Got my heart fluttered, fell off track ♪

302
00:15:57,392 --> 00:15:57,811
Hey.

303
00:15:57,863 --> 00:15:59,093
Hi, everyone.

304
00:15:59,197 --> 00:16:00,207
- Hi.
- Hi.

305
00:16:00,284 --> 00:16:01,909
What’s up? It’s been so long.

306
00:16:02,885 --> 00:16:03,804
Not that long though.

307
00:16:04,327 --> 00:16:06,071
I saw you at the soccer game

308
00:16:06,097 --> 00:16:07,902
but you were with the girls. So…

309
00:16:08,297 --> 00:16:09,100
I didn’t want to bother you.

310
00:16:09,315 --> 00:16:10,717
Hey, Sand.

311
00:16:11,272 --> 00:16:13,567
Don’t make jokes about facts like this.

312
00:16:14,075 --> 00:16:15,560
My friend’s reputation will be damaged.

313
00:16:15,694 --> 00:16:16,982
Warm is surely a playboy.

314
00:16:17,417 --> 00:16:19,567
Not like me, I’m loyal.

315
00:16:19,927 --> 00:16:20,968
Whoa.

316
00:16:21,352 --> 00:16:22,677
You teased me badly.

317
00:16:22,971 --> 00:16:23,481
Come on.

318
00:16:24,121 --> 00:16:25,405
Truth or Dare?

319
00:16:27,539 --> 00:16:28,371
Then…

320
00:16:31,251 --> 00:16:32,072
Truth.

321
00:16:32,537 --> 00:16:33,586
Whoa.

322
00:16:34,336 --> 00:16:36,669
We have to choose the one who will ask, too, right?

323
00:16:37,420 --> 00:16:38,903
You, then. Ask him.

324
00:16:39,214 --> 00:16:40,105
- Me?
- Um.

325
00:16:41,813 --> 00:16:42,330
Sure.

326
00:16:45,428 --> 00:16:46,065
Sand.

327
00:16:47,180 --> 00:16:47,681
Yes.

328
00:16:49,630 --> 00:16:50,851
Can you be my boyfriend already?

329
00:17:07,788 --> 00:17:08,373
Sure.

330
00:17:14,545 --> 00:17:15,263
Damn.

331
00:17:16,345 --> 00:17:17,299
It ended too soon.

332
00:17:17,420 --> 00:17:18,638
I haven’t got to join them.

333
00:17:30,106 --> 00:17:30,567
Hey.

334
00:17:31,635 --> 00:17:32,208
You alright?

335
00:17:32,303 --> 00:17:33,570
Fine. I’m not drunk.

336
00:17:33,645 --> 00:17:34,463
Okay.

337
00:17:35,638 --> 00:17:37,170
Whao.

338
00:17:38,945 --> 00:17:42,506
Quite handsome, Mr. God of Fire.

339
00:17:43,429 --> 00:17:44,619
So f*cking handsome.

340
00:17:44,688 --> 00:17:46,114
Can I touch you a bit?

341
00:17:47,152 --> 00:17:49,405
Hey, you’re drunk. Sit properly.

342
00:17:52,450 --> 00:17:54,582
Ouch, it’s so damn hot.

343
00:17:56,028 --> 00:17:57,360
Will my hand get burned?

344
00:18:00,014 --> 00:18:01,537
Come on, let’s go home.

345
00:18:01,674 --> 00:18:02,342
Arm is drunk.

346
00:18:02,703 --> 00:18:03,213
Not going.

347
00:18:04,062 --> 00:18:05,605
Why go back? I’m not drunk yet.

348
00:18:07,146 --> 00:18:08,025
If you’re more drunk,

349
00:18:08,060 --> 00:18:09,946
we’ll have to send you to hospital.

350
00:18:10,426 --> 00:18:11,314
Yeah, exactly.

351
00:18:11,842 --> 00:18:12,600
We’re leaving first.

352
00:18:12,831 --> 00:18:14,090
- Yeah, see you.
- Come on.

353
00:18:14,394 --> 00:18:16,371
Well, fine.

354
00:18:16,794 --> 00:18:17,426
Bye bye.

355
00:18:17,560 --> 00:18:18,706
- Go back safely, Arm.
- Bye.

356
00:18:20,063 --> 00:18:20,837
Will they make it home?

357
00:18:20,847 --> 00:18:21,576
Good luck.

358
00:18:24,151 --> 00:18:25,160
God of Fire?

359
00:18:25,943 --> 00:18:27,712
Can I touch you a bit?

360
00:18:27,804 --> 00:18:28,514
Ouch, it’s hot.

361
00:18:37,462 --> 00:18:38,296
So excited.

362
00:18:39,010 --> 00:18:40,417
I bring my boyfriend to my room for the first time.

363
00:18:45,180 --> 00:18:47,115
If you make me shy again,

364
00:18:47,522 --> 00:18:48,742
I’ll really go home.

365
00:18:49,368 --> 00:18:51,398
Oh, come here.

366
00:18:52,654 --> 00:18:53,382
Not letting you go.

367
00:18:53,530 --> 00:18:54,611
I’ll sleep with my boyfriend tonight.

368
00:18:55,007 --> 00:18:55,469
Hey.

369
00:18:55,694 --> 00:18:56,897
Don’t do it, Pond.

370
00:18:58,379 --> 00:18:58,917
Why?

371
00:18:59,968 --> 00:19:00,743
Let me peck your cheek a little.

372
00:19:01,672 --> 00:19:02,813
You did it already.

373
00:19:03,955 --> 00:19:04,558
Then….

374
00:19:07,571 --> 00:19:08,407
Can I ask for something else?

375
00:19:28,560 --> 00:19:29,155
Can I?

376
00:19:47,922 --> 00:19:48,619
Wait, wait.

377
00:19:48,936 --> 00:19:49,576
Pond…

378
00:19:50,800 --> 00:19:51,354
Well…

379
00:19:53,665 --> 00:19:55,257
Let me shower first.

380
00:19:57,937 --> 00:19:58,714
Where’s the bathroom?

381
00:19:59,745 --> 00:20:00,508
It’s over there.

382
00:20:08,425 --> 00:20:09,814
Quickly follow me, Pond.

383
00:20:13,013 --> 00:20:13,614
Damn.

384
00:20:14,312 --> 00:20:16,360
Let’s go. I cannot wait anymore.

385
00:20:27,882 --> 00:20:28,731
Hey, Arc.

386
00:20:29,139 --> 00:20:29,665
Um.

387
00:20:30,736 --> 00:20:32,562
You haven’t opened my gift yet.

388
00:20:48,805 --> 00:20:51,305
You gave me as my welcome gift.

389
00:20:52,045 --> 00:20:53,619
So, I’m giving it to you in return.

390
00:20:54,118 --> 00:20:55,342
Thought you liked it.

391
00:20:55,989 --> 00:20:58,616
Did you think that I just messed with you?

392
00:20:58,997 --> 00:20:59,564
Oh,

393
00:21:00,751 --> 00:21:02,568
if it wasn’t that, then what was it?

394
00:21:02,971 --> 00:21:05,857
The dorm is old. The floor is all broken.

395
00:21:06,688 --> 00:21:08,302
I gave you the grout so you could fix it

396
00:21:08,800 --> 00:21:11,019
and the centipede wouldn’t get to hurt you.

397
00:21:11,785 --> 00:21:12,779
Oh, really?

398
00:21:15,053 --> 00:21:16,533
You’re a dummy, indeed.

399
00:21:18,306 --> 00:21:19,217
Sorry.

400
00:21:20,380 --> 00:21:21,709
I won’t sleep after this.

401
00:21:22,285 --> 00:21:24,577
I’ll fix the whole floor.

402
00:21:25,171 --> 00:21:25,731
Okay?

403
00:21:26,675 --> 00:21:27,574
I’m going. Bye bye.

404
00:21:27,982 --> 00:21:28,915
Hey, wait.

405
00:21:31,188 --> 00:21:32,259
I have something for you, too.

406
00:21:33,140 --> 00:21:33,687
Really?

407
00:21:34,022 --> 00:21:34,506
Um.

408
00:21:37,105 --> 00:21:37,677
Here.

409
00:21:41,560 --> 00:21:43,690
“ANOL157-ANON159
AND FOREVER.”

410
00:21:56,641 --> 00:21:57,204
How is it?

411
00:21:57,585 --> 00:21:58,642
All sober now?

412
00:22:01,921 --> 00:22:02,505
Huh?

413
00:22:03,463 --> 00:22:04,505
Still drunk.

414
00:22:05,435 --> 00:22:06,602
Oh, my head hurts.

415
00:22:07,794 --> 00:22:08,620
I better go now.

416
00:22:11,761 --> 00:22:12,768
I better go now.

417
00:22:33,260 --> 00:22:34,001
Why are you looking at me?

418
00:22:37,321 --> 00:22:38,354
Nothing. Just…

419
00:22:39,837 --> 00:22:41,851
I cannot believe I’ve got a boyfriend.

420
00:22:43,088 --> 00:22:45,357
I thought I’d be single for my whole life.

421
00:22:46,887 --> 00:22:47,808
Why did you think so?

422
00:22:49,229 --> 00:22:50,567
Someone told me that

423
00:22:51,260 --> 00:22:53,103
no one would fall for...

424
00:22:54,770 --> 00:22:55,823
a silly person like me.

425
00:22:57,490 --> 00:22:58,783
Don’t think like this again, okay?

426
00:22:59,786 --> 00:23:01,860
You are important to me the most.

427
00:23:02,634 --> 00:23:05,851
‘		I can be this confident because of you.

428
00:23:10,557 --> 00:23:13,370
Maybe I’m meant to be yours alone.

429
00:23:13,832 --> 00:23:14,528
Of course.

430
00:23:15,690 --> 00:23:16,779
You can only be mine.

431
00:23:24,536 --> 00:23:25,619
How can I hold back

432
00:23:26,804 --> 00:23:27,718
if you look at me like this?

433
00:23:28,857 --> 00:23:29,911
Then, why do you hold back?

434
00:23:59,840 --> 00:24:01,650
YEAR 2.

435
00:24:01,780 --> 00:24:02,971
Finally, we’re in Year 2.

436
00:24:03,040 --> 00:24:04,828
I changed my hairstyle a bit.

437
00:24:04,980 --> 00:24:06,088
How is it? Do I look handsome?

438
00:24:06,296 --> 00:24:07,234
If you shave your head…

439
00:24:07,259 --> 00:24:07,940
Will it suit me?

440
00:24:08,053 --> 00:24:08,616
Of course.

441
00:24:08,749 --> 00:24:09,422
It’s unique.

442
00:24:11,466 --> 00:24:13,623
Hey, why do you have this jacket?

443
00:24:14,060 --> 00:24:14,602
Yeah.

444
00:24:15,688 --> 00:24:17,373
I bought it.

445
00:24:17,537 --> 00:24:18,681
They haven’t sold it yet.

446
00:24:21,771 --> 00:24:22,577
Damn it.

447
00:24:22,622 --> 00:24:24,749
- Hey.
- Button up.

448
00:24:25,543 --> 00:24:26,677
Button up.

449
00:24:26,696 --> 00:24:27,659
Damn it.

450
00:24:30,600 --> 00:24:32,780
- That’s enough, Sand.
- Just tell the world about it.

451
00:24:33,697 --> 00:24:34,272
Yeah.

452
00:24:34,709 --> 00:24:35,552
Don’t take it off.

453
00:24:35,856 --> 00:24:37,357
Let’s go.

454
00:24:37,416 --> 00:24:38,059
Yeah, let’s go.

455
00:24:41,826 --> 00:24:44,182
Hey, button up.

456
00:24:44,397 --> 00:24:45,417
Look at him. He might take it off.

457
00:24:45,783 --> 00:24:46,308
Sure.

458
00:24:46,645 --> 00:24:47,722
Who’s that? I wanna know.

459
00:24:48,957 --> 00:24:49,451
Yeah.

460
00:24:52,727 --> 00:24:54,644
Well, I’m going.

461
00:24:54,657 --> 00:24:55,521
See you. Bye.

462
00:24:59,020 --> 00:25:00,444
Going now? We might be late.

463
00:25:01,293 --> 00:25:01,760
Let’s go.

464
00:25:02,074 --> 00:25:04,511

465
00:25:04,564 --> 00:25:08,109

What?

471
00:25:24,453 --> 00:25:25,367
You want some sweets?

472
00:25:25,528 --> 00:25:26,585
Okay, I’ll take you there.

473
00:25:26,850 --> 00:25:27,376
What?

474
00:25:27,582 --> 00:25:28,186
You’re hungry?

475
00:25:28,302 --> 00:25:29,986
Well, I’ll take her to have sweets first

476
00:25:30,001 --> 00:25:32,602
and then I’ll take you out for food later. Okay?

477
00:25:32,625 --> 00:25:33,232
Come on.

478
00:25:33,400 --> 00:25:33,964
Come on.

479
00:25:34,090 --> 00:25:34,734
We might be late.

480
00:25:35,271 --> 00:25:35,794
Let’s go.

481
00:25:37,389 --> 00:25:38,505
Walk carefully, babe.

482
00:25:42,823 --> 00:25:44,142
Thanks for the ride.

483
00:25:44,659 --> 00:25:45,130
Um.

484
00:25:46,060 --> 00:25:47,509
You went back home. How was it?

485
00:25:47,717 --> 00:25:48,805
I gained 5 kg.

486
00:25:49,155 --> 00:25:50,216
Mom’s food was too good.

487
00:25:51,736 --> 00:25:52,222
Hey.

488
00:25:52,840 --> 00:25:53,754
Next time, let me go with you.

489
00:25:54,850 --> 00:25:55,520
Why do you want to go there?

490
00:25:56,638 --> 00:25:57,570
To greet your mom.

491
00:25:58,173 --> 00:25:58,674
Ugh.

492
00:25:59,176 --> 00:26:00,114
You’re talking nonsense again.

493
00:26:00,857 --> 00:26:01,408
I’m leaving.

494
00:26:04,173 --> 00:26:04,960
Oh, Arc.

495
00:26:05,697 --> 00:26:06,712
Don’t have to pick me up today.

496
00:26:07,127 --> 00:26:08,011
Might go home late.

497
00:26:08,149 --> 00:26:09,367
I’ll go back with Sand and the others.

498
00:26:10,357 --> 00:26:11,373
It’s the first day of school.

499
00:26:11,743 --> 00:26:12,622
Why will you finish late?

500
00:26:12,798 --> 00:26:13,694
‘Cause of the prof.

501
00:26:13,927 --> 00:26:15,509
He asked us to help clean the old lab.

502
00:26:15,576 --> 00:26:16,528
Guess they will renovate it.

503
00:26:17,201 --> 00:26:19,336
5 raw score, easy peasy.

504
00:26:19,654 --> 00:26:20,194
Um.

505
00:26:20,890 --> 00:26:21,502
I’m leaving.

506
00:26:23,099 --> 00:26:23,672
Wait.

507
00:26:26,084 --> 00:26:27,312
Tell me when you arrive at the dorm.

508
00:26:27,811 --> 00:26:28,789
Yes, Dad.

509
00:26:30,645 --> 00:26:31,253
Hey, wait.

510
00:26:32,804 --> 00:26:33,528
What’s the matter?

511
00:26:34,130 --> 00:26:35,373
You’re in Year 2 already,

512
00:26:35,970 --> 00:26:37,263
when will you move out of the on-campus dorm?

513
00:26:38,634 --> 00:26:39,718
I’m searching at the moment.

514
00:26:40,048 --> 00:26:41,277
Will move out when I find one.

515
00:26:41,395 --> 00:26:42,463
My condo is still vacant.

516
00:26:43,697 --> 00:26:44,570
In case, you’re interested.

517
00:26:47,075 --> 00:26:47,622
I’m leaving.

518
00:26:47,638 --> 00:26:48,306
Hey, wait.

519
00:26:50,442 --> 00:26:52,705
Another “wait” and I’ll slap your head.

520
00:26:53,925 --> 00:26:55,706
Just want to tell you that
you look cute in this jacket.

521
00:27:01,948 --> 00:27:02,468
Um.

522
00:27:03,466 --> 00:27:04,071
I’m leaving.

523
00:27:16,557 --> 00:27:17,792
So f*cking hungry.

524
00:27:18,484 --> 00:27:19,014
Yeah.

525
00:27:20,505 --> 00:27:22,322
As if my brain consumed all my energy.

526
00:27:22,534 --> 00:27:23,616
We study so hard.

527
00:27:23,705 --> 00:27:25,579
Calm down, guys.

528
00:27:26,271 --> 00:27:27,440
You’re not gonna die from studying,

529
00:27:27,459 --> 00:27:28,884
but from choking on your food at this rate.

530
00:27:29,517 --> 00:27:30,502
Drink some water first.

531
00:27:33,871 --> 00:27:35,610
Will you go straight to the lab after this?

532
00:27:35,700 --> 00:27:37,140
Of course. Finish it quickly and let’s go home.

533
00:27:38,570 --> 00:27:39,213
Yeah, Sand.

534
00:27:39,970 --> 00:27:40,983
About the move-out,

535
00:27:42,146 --> 00:27:42,837
what will we do about it?

536
00:27:46,985 --> 00:27:48,711
- Well…
- You’ll move to live with Pond, right?

537
00:27:49,391 --> 00:27:52,140
If you guys feel upset, I won’t do it.

538
00:27:53,482 --> 00:27:54,620
Will continue to stay with you guys.

539
00:27:54,826 --> 00:27:55,805
You will break up with him

540
00:27:56,134 --> 00:27:57,291
and choose to stay with us?

541
00:27:57,336 --> 00:27:58,056
You bastard.

542
00:27:58,075 --> 00:27:59,004
I won’t break up with him.

543
00:27:59,417 --> 00:28:01,312
I’ll stay with him from Fridays to Sundays.

544
00:28:01,850 --> 00:28:03,136
Just go if you want.

545
00:28:03,302 --> 00:28:04,352
We won’t condemn you.

546
00:28:04,475 --> 00:28:05,960
I can stay together with Po.

547
00:28:08,059 --> 00:28:09,653
Won’t you move out with Arc?

548
00:28:11,200 --> 00:28:12,528
Move out what?

549
00:28:13,339 --> 00:28:14,330
I’ll stay with you.

550
00:28:14,506 --> 00:28:15,768
What’s between you and Arc?

551
00:28:16,102 --> 00:28:16,629
Huh?

552
00:28:19,557 --> 00:28:20,315
What about us?

553
00:28:20,573 --> 00:28:21,571
You dare asking?

554
00:28:21,845 --> 00:28:22,791
You guys like each other this much.

555
00:28:22,810 --> 00:28:24,325
- Why don’t you date already?
- Um.

556
00:28:26,170 --> 00:28:26,869
I don’t know.

557
00:28:27,601 --> 00:28:28,838
Isn't it fine just staying like this?

558
00:28:28,854 --> 00:28:30,380
Like hell it’s fine.

559
00:28:30,884 --> 00:28:33,517
If Arc found someone he liked
more than you and left,

560
00:28:33,896 --> 00:28:35,831
the one who would regret is you.

561
00:28:36,361 --> 00:28:37,411
You’re right.

562
00:28:37,499 --> 00:28:38,005
Yeah.

563
00:28:38,170 --> 00:28:38,976
Honestly though,

564
00:28:39,608 --> 00:28:41,554
you're not even that great, are you?

565
00:28:42,136 --> 00:28:43,145
You talk too much,

566
00:28:43,297 --> 00:28:43,936
eat a lot,

567
00:28:44,080 --> 00:28:44,908
you're loud,

568
00:28:45,146 --> 00:28:47,025
and not to mention, you're kinda dumb.

569
00:28:47,318 --> 00:28:48,157
It's seriously hard to believe

570
00:28:48,176 --> 00:28:50,122
someone like him would actually like you.

571
00:28:51,102 --> 00:28:51,983
- Well, Po.
- Yes.

572
00:28:52,040 --> 00:28:52,737
I’m your friend.

573
00:28:52,767 --> 00:28:53,305
Oops.

574
00:28:58,222 --> 00:29:00,600
Or you haven’t moved on from Sai?

575
00:29:00,989 --> 00:29:02,502
Hey, it has nothing to do with that.

576
00:29:03,468 --> 00:29:06,004
Arc takes me far away from there.

577
00:29:06,373 --> 00:29:07,551
Have you told him

578
00:29:07,834 --> 00:29:08,965
you moved on from that point?

579
00:29:09,838 --> 00:29:10,712
Um…

580
00:29:11,348 --> 00:29:11,982
No idea.

581
00:29:12,696 --> 00:29:14,842
But, I guess he should know it already.

582
00:29:14,871 --> 00:29:15,441
Sigh.

583
00:29:15,650 --> 00:29:16,223
Dude.

584
00:29:16,715 --> 00:29:20,177
Mind games are just for laughs.

585
00:29:20,488 --> 00:29:21,917
Nobody actually uses them in real life.

586
00:29:22,891 --> 00:29:25,617
As I’ve realized, Arc has said his part.

587
00:29:26,428 --> 00:29:27,764
I bet he’s waiting for your answer.

588
00:29:29,863 --> 00:29:30,933
If you like him, then say it.

589
00:29:31,062 --> 00:29:33,180
Don’t play a mind game like this.

590
00:29:33,597 --> 00:29:35,349
You won’t have time for other things.

591
00:29:35,860 --> 00:29:36,368
Exactly.

592
00:29:37,371 --> 00:29:38,080
Whatever.

593
00:29:38,660 --> 00:29:39,709
You guys talk too much.

594
00:29:40,164 --> 00:29:41,481
Quickly eat and go to the lab.

595
00:29:41,508 --> 00:29:43,373
Oh, he changed the topic.

596
00:29:44,440 --> 00:29:45,490
Damn it.

597
00:29:45,894 --> 00:29:47,571
Are we tricked by the prof?

598
00:29:48,254 --> 00:29:48,998
I know, right?

599
00:29:49,128 --> 00:29:51,361
Nobody comes here like us.

600
00:29:51,644 --> 00:29:52,967
If we don’t get the score,

601
00:29:53,576 --> 00:29:55,614
I swear I’m gonna let the air out of all his tires.

602
00:29:55,757 --> 00:29:56,656
So tired.

603
00:29:58,989 --> 00:29:59,829
Let’s go. It’s stingy.

604
00:30:02,740 --> 00:30:03,321
Dude.

605
00:30:03,598 --> 00:30:04,768
I’ll go home today.

606
00:30:05,171 --> 00:30:06,887
I’ll take a leave tomorrow as well.

607
00:30:07,379 --> 00:30:07,965
Why?

608
00:30:08,442 --> 00:30:09,805
Does your grandma call you back?

609
00:30:09,991 --> 00:30:10,515
Heh.

610
00:30:11,357 --> 00:30:13,568
I have to go get some money.

611
00:30:13,712 --> 00:30:14,880
As for me,

612
00:30:15,931 --> 00:30:17,653
Pond asked me to stay over at his place.

613
00:30:17,677 --> 00:30:18,721
- So, I…
- Sand.

614
00:30:18,878 --> 00:30:20,115
So, you will leave me alone?

615
00:30:21,031 --> 00:30:21,714
Can’t help it.

616
00:30:22,207 --> 00:30:23,576
Call Arc to pick you up.

617
00:30:23,656 --> 00:30:24,097
Yeah.

618
00:30:24,115 --> 00:30:24,700
Nah.

619
00:30:24,888 --> 00:30:26,382
What’s wrong?

620
00:30:26,920 --> 00:30:28,530
He's been trying to win you over for a year now.

621
00:30:28,546 --> 00:30:29,779
- Yeah.
- What more do you need to feel sure?

622
00:30:31,324 --> 00:30:32,845
Not that I don’t feel sure.

623
00:30:33,663 --> 00:30:34,247
But…

624
00:30:37,543 --> 00:30:38,280
Damn it.

625
00:30:38,308 --> 00:30:38,977
What’s wrong?

626
00:30:39,564 --> 00:30:40,434
I forgot the jacket at the lab.

627
00:30:40,451 --> 00:30:41,509
Oh, man.

628
00:30:42,197 --> 00:30:43,711
Never mind. Let’s go get it.

629
00:30:44,008 --> 00:30:44,614
Hey, it’s okay.

630
00:30:45,314 --> 00:30:46,309
You guys can go back first.

631
00:30:46,567 --> 00:30:47,921
I’ll leave right after I find the jacket.

632
00:30:49,288 --> 00:30:50,256
It’s about to rain, too.

633
00:30:50,991 --> 00:30:51,751
Don’t worry.

634
00:30:52,371 --> 00:30:52,945
See you.

635
00:30:52,985 --> 00:30:53,653
Yeah, okay.

636
00:30:53,677 --> 00:30:54,491
- See you.
- Bye.

637
00:30:54,514 --> 00:30:55,205
Go back safely.

638
00:30:55,459 --> 00:30:56,376
- See you.
- Go back safely.

639
00:31:03,241 --> 00:31:04,210
Oh gosh.

640
00:31:06,131 --> 00:31:07,362
Why does it have to rain now?

641
00:31:38,167 --> 00:31:39,085
Damn, where is it?

642
00:32:01,232 --> 00:32:01,714
Oh.

643
00:32:01,755 --> 00:32:02,242
Ouch.

644
00:32:02,365 --> 00:32:03,005
Ouch.

645
00:33:06,133 --> 00:33:07,520
I know it’s gonna be like this.

646
00:33:22,072 --> 00:33:22,724
Arc.

647
00:33:23,207 --> 00:33:24,822
I lost your jacket.

648
00:33:24,862 --> 00:33:26,850
I lost it.

649
00:33:29,054 --> 00:33:30,308
I’m sorry.

650
00:33:31,008 --> 00:33:31,936
It’s just a jacket.

651
00:33:32,205 --> 00:33:33,109
If you lost it, then we can buy a new one.

652
00:33:33,122 --> 00:33:33,800
It’s not a problem.

653
00:33:33,841 --> 00:33:35,848
It is. You gave it to me.

654
00:33:35,868 --> 00:33:37,980
I only used it once and lost it already.

655
00:33:39,117 --> 00:33:40,290
I’m sorry.

656
00:33:40,659 --> 00:33:43,176
I think we should go find somewhere
to take cover from the rain first.

657
00:33:43,278 --> 00:33:43,724
Come on.

658
00:33:43,740 --> 00:33:45,607
No, I’ll find it.

659
00:33:45,782 --> 00:33:47,306
- Arm.
- I want to find it.

660
00:33:47,459 --> 00:33:48,004
Arm.

661
00:34:08,327 --> 00:34:08,871
Arm.

662
00:34:10,466 --> 00:34:13,730
Though my jacket is gone, I’m here with you.

663
00:34:20,610 --> 00:34:21,903
You aren’t angry with me, right?

664
00:34:27,402 --> 00:34:28,125
I’ll be angry

665
00:34:28,810 --> 00:34:30,170
if you don’t stop crying.

666
00:34:38,120 --> 00:34:39,272
I’m sorry.

667
00:34:43,404 --> 00:34:44,268
It’s alright, Arm.

668
00:34:45,093 --> 00:34:46,125
It’s just a jacket.

669
00:34:47,145 --> 00:34:47,810
It’s totally fine.

670
00:35:03,174 --> 00:35:03,674
Boy.

671
00:35:03,899 --> 00:35:05,474
Is it your jacket?

672
00:35:05,668 --> 00:35:07,413
I saw it hanging at the door
so I kept it for you.

673
00:35:07,625 --> 00:35:08,377
Yes, it is.

674
00:35:10,914 --> 00:35:11,576
Thank you.

675
00:35:11,697 --> 00:35:12,161
Yeah.

676
00:35:24,339 --> 00:35:25,767
How do you know that I am here?

677
00:35:27,791 --> 00:35:28,386
It’s late

678
00:35:28,854 --> 00:35:30,822
and you haven’t told me if you got to the dorm.

679
00:35:32,558 --> 00:35:33,542
You didn’t pick up my call either.

680
00:35:34,271 --> 00:35:35,542
I had to call Pond

681
00:35:35,674 --> 00:35:37,185
so Sand told me where you were.

682
00:35:39,801 --> 00:35:42,515
I might just forget to call you or happen to sleep.

683
00:35:43,358 --> 00:35:45,608
If it was so, then it’d be great.

684
00:35:46,404 --> 00:35:48,042
Not me seeing you all sullen like this.

685
00:35:55,376 --> 00:35:55,890
Hmm?

686
00:35:56,985 --> 00:35:57,490
Ouch.

687
00:35:59,386 --> 00:36:00,711
Why is there blood here?

688
00:36:01,480 --> 00:36:02,272
Did you get hurt?

689
00:36:03,060 --> 00:36:04,848
Might get it while climbing through the window.

690
00:36:08,595 --> 00:36:09,348
Climbing through the window?

691
00:36:12,265 --> 00:36:13,445
The door was locked.

692
00:36:14,065 --> 00:36:16,506
I remembered I put it inside.

693
00:36:17,128 --> 00:36:18,546
But I couldn’t find it no matter what.

694
00:36:19,081 --> 00:36:20,897
So, I tried to get in and check out.

695
00:36:22,601 --> 00:36:24,210
What if you missed the step?

696
00:36:24,813 --> 00:36:26,011
What if you got hurt even more?

697
00:36:26,832 --> 00:36:27,631
Hey, Arm.

698
00:36:28,171 --> 00:36:29,311
It’s just one jacket.

699
00:36:29,682 --> 00:36:30,882
Why do you care so much about it?

700
00:36:32,514 --> 00:36:34,028
It’s my important thing.

701
00:36:34,791 --> 00:36:36,530
I hate to lose any of my important things.

702
00:36:37,250 --> 00:36:39,170
The more important it is,
the more I don’t want to lose it.

703
00:36:40,706 --> 00:36:41,318
Sigh.

704
00:36:42,800 --> 00:36:45,108
I won’t argue with you anymore today.

705
00:36:46,165 --> 00:36:47,325
Do you have any clean clothes?

706
00:36:49,070 --> 00:36:49,980
What do you need it for?

707
00:36:58,300 --> 00:36:59,180
I only have this.

708
00:37:01,740 --> 00:37:03,469
Hey, Arc.

709
00:37:03,998 --> 00:37:05,514
Don’t do this. My foot is dirty.

710
00:37:06,580 --> 00:37:07,180
Hey.

711
00:37:08,530 --> 00:37:10,020
Will this even wash out?

712
00:37:10,834 --> 00:37:11,367
Hey,

713
00:37:11,890 --> 00:37:13,874
maybe worry about the germs
getting into you first?

714
00:37:14,109 --> 00:37:14,671
Huh?

715
00:37:16,244 --> 00:37:17,982
It’s what you gave me.

716
00:37:19,339 --> 00:37:20,666
I don’t dare to use it.

717
00:37:21,183 --> 00:37:22,312
Your name is embroidered here.

718
00:37:23,157 --> 00:37:25,322
The maker must pay so much attention to it.

719
00:37:27,971 --> 00:37:28,527
Hey.

720
00:37:29,345 --> 00:37:30,441
What are you doing?

721
00:37:30,820 --> 00:37:31,965
Why are you surprised? Here.

722
00:37:33,826 --> 00:37:34,875
Dare to use it now?

723
00:37:36,377 --> 00:37:38,025
Only this and it’s now mine?

724
00:37:39,300 --> 00:37:40,051
Yours?

725
00:37:42,810 --> 00:37:43,318
Hey.

726
00:37:44,927 --> 00:37:46,031
This’s your man, too.

727
00:38:00,828 --> 00:38:01,463
Don't worry.

728
00:38:02,182 --> 00:38:04,620
If I wash it, I promise it'll be as good as new.

729
00:38:07,365 --> 00:38:08,216
You promise, right?

730
00:38:09,065 --> 00:38:09,583
Um.

731
00:38:24,927 --> 00:38:25,497
Arc.

732
00:38:27,462 --> 00:38:27,983
Huh?

733
00:38:29,367 --> 00:38:30,327
Do you still…

734
00:38:33,182 --> 00:38:34,711
feeling the same towards me?

735
00:38:43,905 --> 00:38:44,531
Not anymore.

736
00:38:50,687 --> 00:38:51,425
Why is that?

737
00:38:53,844 --> 00:38:55,370
Did I have to wait for too long?

738
00:39:00,508 --> 00:39:01,023
Nah.

739
00:39:02,783 --> 00:39:03,647
I mean

740
00:39:05,982 --> 00:39:07,183
I don’t love you the same.

741
00:39:11,030 --> 00:39:13,509
But I love you even more, Arm.

742
00:39:26,831 --> 00:39:27,715
Sorry

743
00:39:30,020 --> 00:39:31,263
for keeping you waiting for so long.

744
00:39:35,857 --> 00:39:36,976
Now, I think…

745
00:39:39,480 --> 00:39:40,442
I love you already.

746
00:39:41,401 --> 00:39:42,617
I really love you now.

747
00:39:46,598 --> 00:39:47,720
Love you so much.

748
00:39:51,979 --> 00:39:52,905
So it’s worth it.

749
00:39:57,684 --> 00:39:58,825

Here.

758
00:40:23,371 --> 00:40:24,177
Can you stand?

759
00:40:25,386 --> 00:40:26,245
Totally fine.

760
00:40:28,044 --> 00:40:29,117
Just leave me here.

761
00:40:29,711 --> 00:40:30,871
I can shower by myself.

762
00:40:32,328 --> 00:40:33,167
Sure you can stand up?

763
00:40:36,804 --> 00:40:37,226
Hey.

764
00:40:38,152 --> 00:40:38,925
Oh…

765
00:40:41,872 --> 00:40:42,632
Hehe.

766
00:40:49,025 --> 00:40:50,219
Then just sit tight right here.

767
00:40:50,534 --> 00:40:51,743
I’ll grab the first aid kit,

768
00:40:51,950 --> 00:40:53,251
clean your wound, wipe you down,

769
00:40:53,340 --> 00:40:54,715
change your clothes,
and you can sleep here tonight.

770
00:40:59,780 --> 00:41:00,325
Arc.

771
00:41:09,451 --> 00:41:10,373
Can I ask you this?

772
00:41:12,888 --> 00:41:14,635
Why do you love me?

773
00:41:24,192 --> 00:41:24,724
Hey.

774
00:41:25,460 --> 00:41:26,044
Where are you going?

775
00:41:26,216 --> 00:41:27,613
- Huh?
- Won’t you go draw your peer mentee?

776
00:41:28,146 --> 00:41:28,656
Nah.

777
00:41:28,878 --> 00:41:29,503
I’m lazy.

778
00:41:29,840 --> 00:41:31,231
Oh, lazy?

779
00:41:31,265 --> 00:41:32,795
You’re all stuck-up now that you’re a senior?

780
00:41:32,960 --> 00:41:33,462
Huh?

781
00:41:34,885 --> 00:41:35,813
Go with me.

782
00:41:36,308 --> 00:41:38,002
Dude, I don’t have my car today.

783
00:41:38,508 --> 00:41:39,708
So, I can go back with you.

784
00:41:40,680 --> 00:41:41,257
Join me.

785
00:41:44,717 --> 00:41:46,019
Alright, Arm,

786
00:41:46,380 --> 00:41:47,917
your peer mentor’s code is

787
00:41:48,340 --> 00:41:51,918
0498.

788
00:41:59,665 --> 00:42:01,680
Whoa, he’s cute though.

789
00:42:03,760 --> 00:42:04,602
Which part of him is cute?

790
00:42:05,103 --> 00:42:06,315
His eyes are all gone once he smiles.

791
00:42:08,480 --> 00:42:09,019
Look at him.

792
00:42:09,134 --> 00:42:10,317
He looks so dumb, too.

793
00:42:12,530 --> 00:42:13,284
Which part of him is cute?

794
00:42:20,669 --> 00:42:24,275
♪ You’re the love suspect, hard to crack ♪

795

796
00:42:31,746 --> 00:42:32,459
Oh.

797
00:42:33,342 --> 00:42:35,078
You’ve targeted me since the first day we met?

798
00:42:37,453 --> 00:42:38,475
So wicked.

799
00:42:38,998 --> 00:42:40,567
And you said I wasn’t cute.

800
00:42:40,842 --> 00:42:42,146
You ended up falling for me.

801
00:42:42,229 --> 00:42:43,320
What a wimp.

802
00:42:46,442 --> 00:42:47,312
And what’s your name again?

803
00:42:47,589 --> 00:42:49,060
His name is Arm.

804
00:42:49,674 --> 00:42:50,515
Arc and Arm.

805
00:42:50,688 --> 00:42:51,915
Your names sound similar.

806
00:42:52,099 --> 00:42:53,856
You’re going to your condo, right, Arc?

807
00:42:54,740 --> 00:42:55,825
Please give Arm a ride.

808
00:42:56,001 --> 00:42:56,522
No.

809
00:42:56,880 --> 00:42:57,714
I just had my car washed.

810
00:42:58,204 --> 00:42:58,807
I’m leaving.

811
00:43:03,405 --> 00:43:05,023
Why did I have to run my mouth now?

812
00:43:14,508 --> 00:43:16,814
Still, I was so bummed about that day, you know?

813
00:43:18,447 --> 00:43:19,026
Why?

814
00:43:19,210 --> 00:43:20,807
If I hadn't shot my mouth off that day,

815
00:43:21,515 --> 00:43:23,008
you would’ve gotten in my car for the first time.

816
00:43:23,260 --> 00:43:24,708
So, you ended up taking me to a crash instead?

817
00:43:25,705 --> 00:43:27,441
Really makes me appreciate it, huh?

818
00:43:29,573 --> 00:43:32,065
But that day, I really felt bad.

819
00:43:32,425 --> 00:43:34,025
When I turned around and saw you just like that,

820
00:43:34,940 --> 00:43:36,974
damn, I got so mad at myself
for putting you in that risky situation.

821
00:43:38,976 --> 00:43:40,005
But it was worth it, though.

822
00:43:40,561 --> 00:43:41,782
I was shocked for just a moment,

823
00:43:42,260 --> 00:43:44,500
but you completely stopped
driving recklessly after that.

824
00:43:45,764 --> 00:43:46,626
Let me ask you,

825
00:43:47,503 --> 00:43:49,413
why didn't you care about yourself before?

826
00:43:52,820 --> 00:43:54,407
I felt like

827
00:43:54,628 --> 00:43:55,570
if I died,

828
00:43:56,204 --> 00:43:57,314
I wouldn't have anything to worry about.

829
00:43:58,177 --> 00:44:00,487
But if I didn't get back at those a*sholes,

830
00:44:01,008 --> 00:44:02,515
even my spirit wouldn't be able to die in peace.

831
00:44:04,364 --> 00:44:05,709
What a lame logic.

832
00:44:06,222 --> 00:44:07,819
But now I don't think like that anymore.

833
00:44:08,350 --> 00:44:09,274
I'm scared of dying too soon.

834
00:44:10,315 --> 00:44:11,469
And not being able to stay with you.

835
00:44:17,986 --> 00:44:21,274
I want to live with you for a long time, Arm.

836
00:44:28,794 --> 00:44:29,712
Can you keep talking?

837
00:44:30,023 --> 00:44:33,370
What about the reasons why you love me?

838
00:44:39,921 --> 00:44:42,112
I’m Arm Anon Phuwakomol.

839
00:44:42,142 --> 00:44:43,703
Representative from Electrical Engineering.

840
00:44:46,300 --> 00:44:46,810
What?

841
00:44:47,201 --> 00:44:47,823
What are you saying?

842
00:44:51,764 --> 00:44:52,522
Arm!

843
00:44:54,425 --> 00:44:56,150
Po, my leg!

844
00:44:58,075 --> 00:44:59,807
Remove Arm's name from the competition.

845
00:45:00,170 --> 00:45:01,857
I do not allow him to compete for the campus star.

846
00:45:02,960 --> 00:45:03,765
Got it?

847
00:45:06,342 --> 00:45:07,220
So clumsy.

848
00:45:08,358 --> 00:45:09,500
Hey, Arc.

849
00:45:09,961 --> 00:45:10,893
How am I selfish?

850
00:45:11,077 --> 00:45:11,878
You’re selfish

851
00:45:12,410 --> 00:45:14,034
because I’m the only one trying to get to know you.

852
00:45:14,478 --> 00:45:15,872
Fine, I’ll get to know you too.

853
00:45:21,674 --> 00:45:22,764
You’re the one who kissed me.

854
00:45:22,848 --> 00:45:23,909
I’m affected too.

855
00:45:24,081 --> 00:45:24,807
What do you mean you’re affected?

856
00:45:24,902 --> 00:45:26,231
You made me catch feelings.

857
00:45:26,986 --> 00:45:27,717
I’m affected.

858
00:45:28,408 --> 00:45:29,133
My heart is.

859
00:45:31,290 --> 00:45:32,902
You don’t sound like the Arc I know.

860
00:45:33,859 --> 00:45:34,625
I can’t believe I said that.

861
00:45:35,269 --> 00:45:36,321
Then the hotel…

862
00:45:37,171 --> 00:45:39,117
How we got to see Tawan was your plan, right?

863
00:45:39,634 --> 00:45:40,183
Yep.

864
00:45:41,859 --> 00:45:42,494
I knew it.

865
00:45:43,001 --> 00:45:44,413
Actually, Pun would take me there.

866
00:45:44,485 --> 00:45:45,072
That’s right.

867
00:45:47,598 --> 00:45:48,594
You took advantage of me.

868
00:45:48,628 --> 00:45:49,130
Heh.

869
00:45:50,371 --> 00:45:51,133
Hey, Arm.

870
00:45:52,385 --> 00:45:53,610
If I really took advantage of you…

871
00:46:01,100 --> 00:46:02,364
You wouldn’t survive till these days.

872
00:46:04,708 --> 00:46:05,965
I kinda thought so.

873
00:46:06,601 --> 00:46:08,004
Wouldn’t be able to get away from you.

874
00:46:25,810 --> 00:46:26,706
I’m going to kiss you, okay?

875
00:47:04,291 --> 00:47:05,207
Can I do more?

876
00:47:08,237 --> 00:47:09,204
What will you do?

877
00:47:16,512 --> 00:47:18,208
Gonna do what lovers do together.

878
00:47:25,659 --> 00:47:26,263
But…

879
00:47:29,306 --> 00:47:30,628
But if you’re not ready yet,

880
00:47:32,608 --> 00:47:33,314
it’s okay.

881
00:48:10,751 --> 00:48:11,928
Arm, you trust me, right?

882
00:48:17,570 --> 00:48:19,527
I’ve trusted you since that day at the beach.

883
00:49:26,854 --> 00:49:27,690
I love you, Arm.

884
00:49:30,062 --> 00:49:31,020
I love you, too.

885
00:49:32,838 --> 00:49:33,401
Arc.

886
00:49:37,511 --> 00:49:38,314
Let’s go out.

887
00:49:44,910 --> 00:49:46,405
Thought we were already dating for a long time.

888
00:50:29,800 --> 00:50:31,614
Hey, Arc. Our mentee is out.

889
00:50:31,930 --> 00:50:32,945
Arm, don’t run. You might fall.

890
00:50:35,108 --> 00:50:36,014
Why did you laugh?

891
00:50:37,282 --> 00:50:38,620
Why don’t I see you with him?

892
00:50:38,792 --> 00:50:39,906
He hates crowded places.

893
00:50:40,235 --> 00:50:41,157
He says it’s too chaotic.

894
00:50:42,567 --> 00:50:43,515
So damn mysterious.

895
00:50:49,317 --> 00:50:50,579
Here, he’s Yotha.

896
00:50:50,950 --> 00:50:52,010
Does he seem as mysterious as you thought?
