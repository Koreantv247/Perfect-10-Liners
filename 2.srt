4
00:00:17,133 --> 00:00:20,871
I'd like my peer mentee
to take over the page admin role.

5
00:00:20,871 --> 00:00:21,681
It shouldn't be hard.

6
00:00:25,068 --> 00:00:25,887
And what's your name again?

7
00:00:25,887 --> 00:00:27,154
His name is Arm.

8
00:00:27,154 --> 00:00:28,216
Arm and Arc.

9
00:00:28,216 --> 00:00:29,663
Your names sound similar.

10
00:00:29,829 --> 00:00:32,128
I heard some seniors tried to convince you
to compete for campus star.

11
00:00:35,308 --> 00:00:36,463
Go with Arc.

12
00:00:37,378 --> 00:00:38,882
Why do you love messing with me so much?

13
00:00:40,254 --> 00:00:41,714
Apart from you, Arm,

14
00:00:41,901 --> 00:00:43,412
I don't want to mess with anyone else.

15
00:00:54,448 --> 00:00:56,451
WHOSE PHONE DID WE USE TO TAKE
GROUP PHOTOS YESTERDAY?

16
00:00:56,451 --> 00:00:57,907
CAN YOU POST THEM TO WELCOME OUR JUNIOR?

17
00:01:13,330 --> 00:01:14,025
Shit!

18
00:01:14,295 --> 00:01:15,811
Why the heck did you stop?

19
00:01:15,811 --> 00:01:17,341
Why the hell did you stop?

20
00:01:19,048 --> 00:01:20,742
MY PEER MENTEE'S MENTEE IS POLITE.

21
00:01:20,742 --> 00:01:22,893
HE HAD TO BOW DOWN ON THE FLOOR
BEFORE HIS RUNWAY WALK.

22
00:01:22,893 --> 00:01:25,395
Damn it, Arc!

23
00:01:25,728 --> 00:01:26,762
So clumsy.

24
00:01:31,563 --> 00:01:32,803
Hey.

25
00:01:33,946 --> 00:01:34,673
Where are you going?

26
00:01:34,673 --> 00:01:35,452
I'm going to kill…

27
00:01:35,452 --> 00:01:36,549
You're going to check attendance.

28
00:01:36,549 --> 00:01:37,242
You don't want to be late.

29
00:01:37,886 --> 00:01:38,865
Let go of me!

30
00:01:38,865 --> 00:01:40,427
I'm going to take my revenge!

31
00:01:41,342 --> 00:01:43,784
It's not too late to get your revenge
10 years from now.

32
00:01:43,888 --> 00:01:44,467
Let go of me!

33
00:01:44,467 --> 00:01:45,858
But if you don't go to the attendance check now,
you'll be late.

34
00:01:45,858 --> 00:01:47,589
I'm going to kill him!

35
00:01:47,760 --> 00:01:49,995
MY PEER MENTEE'S MENTEE IS POLITE.
HE HAD TO BOW DOWN ON THE FLOOR
BEFORE HIS RUNWAY WALK. @Armm01

36
00:01:50,182 --> 00:01:51,053
You're such a gossip.

37
00:01:51,053 --> 00:01:52,163
You always flirt with girls.

38
00:01:52,641 --> 00:01:53,886
- As if you're a good person.
- Hey.

39
00:01:57,752 --> 00:01:58,618
I already liked your post.

40
00:02:01,195 --> 00:02:03,014
Hey, are you guys free this evening?

41
00:02:03,513 --> 00:02:04,120
Why?

42
00:02:04,120 --> 00:02:04,926
Let's play football.

43
00:02:05,466 --> 00:02:05,966
Huh?

44
00:02:07,151 --> 00:02:08,618
We play every day.

45
00:02:09,013 --> 00:02:10,648
Lately, you're the one
who's always ditching us.

46
00:02:10,648 --> 00:02:11,361
Yeah.

47
00:02:12,463 --> 00:02:13,567
You've got it bad.

48
00:02:14,003 --> 00:02:14,694
What have I got?

49
00:02:14,839 --> 00:02:15,514
I know

50
00:02:15,784 --> 00:02:18,966
our electrical major has to replace
our campus star representative

51
00:02:19,091 --> 00:02:19,846
and who's behind it.

52
00:04:04,641 --> 00:04:06,111
Damn it!

53
00:04:06,111 --> 00:04:08,145
Why are you freaking out?

54
00:04:08,602 --> 00:04:10,176
Look on the bright side.

55
00:04:10,176 --> 00:04:11,518
Arc's Instagram is private.

56
00:04:11,518 --> 00:04:12,920
Not that many people may have seen your photo.

57
00:04:12,920 --> 00:04:14,982
His followers increased by 1,200
and you say not many people have seen it?

58
00:04:14,982 --> 00:04:16,503
Damn it!

59
00:04:16,503 --> 00:04:17,555
If you have thousands of followers,

60
00:04:17,555 --> 00:04:19,301
you could become an influencer.

61
00:04:22,148 --> 00:04:22,763
Really?

62
00:04:22,840 --> 00:04:23,561
Yeah.

63
00:04:25,120 --> 00:04:28,126
Does being an influencer pay well?

64
00:04:28,313 --> 00:04:29,469
Really well.

65
00:04:29,677 --> 00:04:30,416
Really?

66
00:04:30,416 --> 00:04:31,262
Yeah.

67
00:04:32,738 --> 00:04:35,644
Why don't we go back to our dorm
and learn how to become an influencer?

68
00:04:35,644 --> 00:04:36,146
Great idea.

69
00:04:36,146 --> 00:04:37,140
Let's get rich.

70
00:04:37,140 --> 00:04:38,452
Let's not go see Arc anymore.

71
00:04:38,452 --> 00:04:38,952
No.

72
00:04:39,326 --> 00:04:39,829
Okay.

73
00:04:39,829 --> 00:04:40,329
Let's go.

74
00:04:40,329 --> 00:04:40,829
Let's go.

75
00:04:41,307 --> 00:04:42,377
Hey, Arm.

76
00:04:42,564 --> 00:04:44,415
Hi, Pun. Hi, Jet.

77
00:04:44,415 --> 00:04:45,349
- Hi.
- Hi.

78
00:04:45,349 --> 00:04:47,623
Yeepun and I have some errands to run.

79
00:04:47,748 --> 00:04:51,150
Can you please bring these football boots
to Arc at the field?

80
00:04:51,649 --> 00:04:53,382
He called us and sounded like
he needed them urgently.

81
00:04:55,544 --> 00:04:56,739
Of course, Jet.

82
00:04:57,300 --> 00:04:59,158
I was just thinking of going to see him.

83
00:04:59,158 --> 00:04:59,811
Don't go.

84
00:05:00,331 --> 00:05:01,442
Hey, Arm!

85
00:05:02,336 --> 00:05:03,091
Follow him!

86
00:05:03,091 --> 00:05:04,158
To where?

87
00:05:04,158 --> 00:05:05,502
To stop that chihuahua with no filter.

88
00:05:05,502 --> 00:05:07,531
I'll have to leave this mission to you.

89
00:05:07,531 --> 00:05:08,063
What?

90
00:05:08,063 --> 00:05:09,666
I have to go eat with my grandma.

91
00:05:09,666 --> 00:05:10,202
Your grandma?

92
00:05:10,202 --> 00:05:10,929
Bye.

93
00:05:10,929 --> 00:05:11,795
Wait!

94
00:05:12,000 --> 00:05:12,511
Your grandma?

95
00:05:12,781 --> 00:05:14,650
Is something wrong?

96
00:05:14,983 --> 00:05:16,467
I don't have time to explain.

97
00:05:16,467 --> 00:05:17,481
My friend's life is more important.

98
00:05:17,481 --> 00:05:18,146
I have to go.

99
00:05:18,146 --> 00:05:19,584
Bye. See you later.

100
00:05:25,487 --> 00:05:25,987
Arc!

101
00:05:26,964 --> 00:05:28,316
Arc, you jerk!

102
00:05:29,106 --> 00:05:30,217
Arc, you jerk!

103
00:05:30,674 --> 00:05:31,400
You jerk!

104
00:05:31,400 --> 00:05:32,192
Hey!

105
00:05:33,605 --> 00:05:35,085
Why did you shut my mouth, Sand?

106
00:05:35,293 --> 00:05:36,593
Talking like that will get you in trouble.

107
00:05:36,593 --> 00:05:37,903
You think I'm afraid?

108
00:05:37,903 --> 00:05:40,694
Arc, you jerk!

109
00:05:40,694 --> 00:05:41,278
Arm.

110
00:05:41,278 --> 00:05:42,282
Be polite.

111
00:05:42,677 --> 00:05:44,716
Why should I be polite with someone like him?

112
00:05:44,820 --> 00:05:46,129
He's so annoying.

113
00:05:46,462 --> 00:05:48,668
I'd even call him Asshole Arc.

114
00:05:48,855 --> 00:05:49,850
Asshole Arc!

115
00:05:49,850 --> 00:05:50,931
- Asshole Arc!
- What are you calling me?

116
00:06:00,303 --> 00:06:03,340
It's not true, is it?

117
00:06:03,340 --> 00:06:03,840
It is.

118
00:06:05,378 --> 00:06:06,538
What question is that the answer to?

119
00:06:06,538 --> 00:06:08,078
What did you just call me, Arm?

120
00:06:13,066 --> 00:06:13,841
Watch out!

121
00:06:29,367 --> 00:06:30,529
Be careful when you're playing!

122
00:06:33,460 --> 00:06:34,006
Are you alright?

123
00:06:36,000 --> 00:06:37,117
I'm fine.

124
00:06:37,117 --> 00:06:38,394
Are you alright?

125
00:06:38,394 --> 00:06:38,937
Hey.

126
00:06:40,766 --> 00:06:41,965
Looks like you're hurt badly.

127
00:06:42,110 --> 00:06:43,080
Do you want to take him to the clinic?

128
00:06:43,080 --> 00:06:43,651
Huh?

129
00:06:44,649 --> 00:06:46,301
Let's make way for Arc to deal with his junior.

130
00:06:48,733 --> 00:06:50,334
Ouch!

131
00:06:50,500 --> 00:06:51,359
It hurts so bad!

132
00:06:51,359 --> 00:06:52,251
Are you hurt?

133
00:06:52,251 --> 00:06:52,916
I can't take this anymore.

134
00:06:53,436 --> 00:06:54,019
Sand.

135
00:06:54,019 --> 00:06:54,850
See you later.

136
00:06:54,850 --> 00:06:55,544
Come on. Let's go.

137
00:06:55,544 --> 00:06:56,648
Okay. Let's go.

138
00:06:56,648 --> 00:06:57,536
Are you alright?

139
00:07:12,231 --> 00:07:13,093
Excuse me.

140
00:07:13,571 --> 00:07:16,439
Does it not hurt anymore?

141
00:07:16,439 --> 00:07:17,409
Why are you walking normally?

142
00:07:18,968 --> 00:07:19,469
Oh.

143
00:07:20,321 --> 00:07:22,471
It still hurts. Ouch!

144
00:07:22,554 --> 00:07:23,999
It hurts so bad!

145
00:07:23,999 --> 00:07:24,950
Ouch!

146
00:07:25,802 --> 00:07:27,247
Is it so bad that you can't walk?

147
00:07:27,808 --> 00:07:29,945
Yeah, I think I need to sit down for a while.

148
00:07:33,790 --> 00:07:35,101
Then please wait for me here.

149
00:07:35,101 --> 00:07:36,287
- I'll be right back.
- Hey.

150
00:07:36,287 --> 00:07:36,924
Where are you going?

151
00:07:39,917 --> 00:07:40,624
Hey!

152
00:07:41,289 --> 00:07:42,360
What are you guys doing?

153
00:07:42,360 --> 00:07:43,422
Come back to practice!

154
00:07:43,422 --> 00:07:44,680
I'm about to!

155
00:07:44,680 --> 00:07:45,294
Come on!

156
00:07:49,991 --> 00:07:51,292
What's up, smarty pants?

157
00:07:51,536 --> 00:07:53,848
What are you doing here?

158
00:07:57,818 --> 00:07:59,027
Jet asked me to return your shoes.

159
00:08:01,459 --> 00:08:02,162
You only came for this?

160
00:08:02,328 --> 00:08:03,018
Of course.

161
00:08:05,159 --> 00:08:05,685
Here.

162
00:08:06,184 --> 00:08:07,191
I don't need them now.

163
00:08:07,690 --> 00:08:08,706
Then put them away yourself.

164
00:08:08,893 --> 00:08:09,406
Hey.

165
00:08:13,168 --> 00:08:14,081
I don't want to lose them.

166
00:08:14,081 --> 00:08:14,889
Watch them.

167
00:08:16,094 --> 00:08:16,673
Hey.

168
00:08:18,855 --> 00:08:21,767
If I don't see you sitting here from the field,

169
00:08:22,515 --> 00:08:23,594
you'll be in trouble.

170
00:08:40,160 --> 00:08:40,965
Damn it!

171
00:08:41,879 --> 00:08:42,683
Damn it!

172
00:08:47,006 --> 00:08:47,820
Woo!

173
00:08:48,686 --> 00:08:50,055
Watch your legs!

174
00:08:51,385 --> 00:08:52,303
Here you go.

175
00:08:54,942 --> 00:08:56,029
Why did you bring the cart?

176
00:08:56,029 --> 00:08:59,215
You're hurt so badly that you can't walk,
so I borrowed it from the cleaning lady.

177
00:09:00,150 --> 00:09:01,056
I've already washed it

178
00:09:01,492 --> 00:09:02,500
but be careful of the splinters.

179
00:09:02,500 --> 00:09:04,040
It's okay. I can walk.

180
00:09:04,040 --> 00:09:04,833
Hey. Let me help.

181
00:09:04,833 --> 00:09:05,683
You can't walk.

182
00:09:05,683 --> 00:09:06,627
I can walk.

183
00:09:07,374 --> 00:09:08,479
Can we get through?

184
00:09:08,479 --> 00:09:09,360
Excuse me!

185
00:09:15,907 --> 00:09:16,696
We've arrived.

186
00:09:19,710 --> 00:09:20,642
What am I doing?

187
00:09:22,014 --> 00:09:23,236
Do you need me to carry you?

188
00:09:23,236 --> 00:09:23,840
Come on.

189
00:09:37,920 --> 00:09:38,467
Hey.

190
00:09:39,215 --> 00:09:40,269
What brings you here, A-ngun?

191
00:09:41,121 --> 00:09:44,214
I was passing by and saw you sitting here,

192
00:09:44,546 --> 00:09:45,947
so I came to say hi.

193
00:09:51,226 --> 00:09:52,053
Ah.

194
00:09:53,591 --> 00:09:54,135
Oh.

195
00:09:55,860 --> 00:09:58,280
I got you some snacks.

196
00:09:58,388 --> 00:09:59,037
This is for me?

197
00:10:00,745 --> 00:10:01,338
Thanks.

198
00:10:01,899 --> 00:10:04,233
And this is for Arc.

199
00:10:06,240 --> 00:10:08,447
Hey, do you want me to keep it?

200
00:10:08,655 --> 00:10:09,413
To make sure it doesn't go missing.

201
00:10:09,974 --> 00:10:10,913
It won't.

202
00:10:11,204 --> 00:10:13,283
Everything here is for Arc.

203
00:10:15,237 --> 00:10:15,821
Huh?

204
00:10:16,487 --> 00:10:17,259
How can he eat all that by himself?

205
00:10:17,440 --> 00:10:18,108
By the way,

206
00:10:19,251 --> 00:10:22,529
what did Arc say about my IG follow request?

207
00:10:22,529 --> 00:10:24,615
He hasn't accepted your request?

208
00:10:24,948 --> 00:10:25,862
Not yet.

209
00:10:28,522 --> 00:10:30,604
Let me talk to him again.

210
00:10:31,248 --> 00:10:32,413
Thank you, Arm.

211
00:10:32,413 --> 00:10:34,158
You're the cutest.

212
00:10:35,883 --> 00:10:36,965
Just score a goal!

213
00:10:40,166 --> 00:10:41,446
I should go.

214
00:10:41,446 --> 00:10:42,237
See you around.

215
00:10:42,445 --> 00:10:43,350
Wait, A-ngun!

216
00:10:46,364 --> 00:10:47,357
Oh, shit.

217
00:10:48,521 --> 00:10:49,402
Don't touch me.

218
00:10:49,402 --> 00:10:50,337
You're sweating all over.

219
00:10:50,670 --> 00:10:52,050
Hey! You're dirty!

220
00:10:52,050 --> 00:10:52,780
Damn it!

221
00:10:53,154 --> 00:10:53,734
What's that?

222
00:10:55,875 --> 00:10:57,081
Hey, Arc!

223
00:10:58,723 --> 00:11:00,227
Damn it! What are you doing?

224
00:11:04,093 --> 00:11:05,457
Are you mad that I posted your photo?

225
00:11:07,390 --> 00:11:08,780
If you were me, wouldn't you be mad

226
00:11:08,780 --> 00:11:09,994
about being photographed like that?

227
00:11:10,929 --> 00:11:13,359
Falling in the auditorium was embarrassing enough.

228
00:11:13,359 --> 00:11:14,594
You didn't have to post a photo of it too.

229
00:11:14,594 --> 00:11:16,749
And don't even say your account is private.

230
00:11:16,749 --> 00:11:18,370
What private account has 3-4 thousand followers?

231
00:11:18,370 --> 00:11:19,316
Not to say people screenshotted it

232
00:11:19,316 --> 00:11:20,646
and made tons of memes.

233
00:11:20,646 --> 00:11:22,174
I'm embarrassed, you know?

234
00:11:32,120 --> 00:11:32,963
But I like it.

235
00:11:45,674 --> 00:11:46,751
Are you a psycho?

236
00:11:49,557 --> 00:11:50,579
Are you almost done?

237
00:11:50,745 --> 00:11:51,536
I'm going to leave soon.

238
00:11:53,427 --> 00:11:54,594
Why are you complaining so much?

239
00:11:55,529 --> 00:11:57,290
Because I don't want to freaking wait.

240
00:11:59,798 --> 00:12:02,285
You're being rude again, Arm.

241
00:12:06,962 --> 00:12:07,560
I

242
00:12:09,389 --> 00:12:11,329
don't want to wait.

243
00:12:12,202 --> 00:12:12,900
Okay?

244
00:12:14,320 --> 00:12:15,929
Once you've been here a few times,
you'll get used to it.

245
00:12:18,174 --> 00:12:20,014
What do you mean I'll get used to it?

246
00:12:20,430 --> 00:12:22,208
Other people would have
their partner waiting for them,

247
00:12:22,541 --> 00:12:24,154
not dumping it on
their peer mentee's mentee like this.

248
00:12:27,500 --> 00:12:28,416
I'm single.

249
00:12:28,811 --> 00:12:29,633
Then hurry up and find someone.

250
00:12:31,753 --> 00:12:32,516
I am hurrying.

251
00:12:47,709 --> 00:12:49,160
Fine. I'm leaving.

252
00:12:51,467 --> 00:12:52,013
Here.

253
00:12:58,519 --> 00:12:59,134
Wait.

254
00:13:01,109 --> 00:13:02,142
What now?

255
00:13:04,844 --> 00:13:05,972
Bring your snacks home.

256
00:13:06,180 --> 00:13:06,775
What snacks?

257
00:13:09,851 --> 00:13:10,517
There.

258
00:13:10,517 --> 00:13:11,358
P'ARC, YOU'RE SO HANDSOME.
ROOTING FOR YOU, P'ARC.

259
00:13:11,358 --> 00:13:11,981
YOU'RE SO COOL, P'ARC.

260
00:13:16,554 --> 00:13:18,099
YOU'RE SO COOL, P'ARM.

261
00:13:18,099 --> 00:13:18,648
Here you go.

262
00:13:20,640 --> 00:13:22,644
YOU'RE SO COOL, P'ARM.

263
00:13:23,455 --> 00:13:24,013
What?

264
00:13:24,320 --> 00:13:25,491
My car is parked in the same spot.

265
00:13:26,759 --> 00:13:27,819
Hurry up and follow me.

266
00:13:31,851 --> 00:13:33,289
What's going on?

267
00:13:42,920 --> 00:13:43,818
Is this your condo?

268
00:13:43,818 --> 00:13:44,364
Yeah.

269
00:13:44,364 --> 00:13:44,968
Oh.

270
00:13:44,968 --> 00:13:46,213
Freshmen need to stay
in the on-campus dorm, right?

271
00:13:46,344 --> 00:13:49,313
Yes. The rooms are so tiny.

272
00:13:49,313 --> 00:13:51,279
The water runs on and off.

273
00:13:52,089 --> 00:13:53,562
Have you booked a ride?

274
00:13:53,562 --> 00:13:54,586
Yes.

275
00:13:56,578 --> 00:13:58,169
It got canceled.

276
00:13:58,169 --> 00:13:59,028
Oh?

277
00:14:00,342 --> 00:14:01,172
It's okay.

278
00:14:01,172 --> 00:14:02,843
I can get a motorbike taxi on the main road.

279
00:14:03,106 --> 00:14:05,126
Thank you for today.

280
00:14:05,695 --> 00:14:06,973
If it wasn't for you,

281
00:14:06,973 --> 00:14:08,075
my face would've been smashed.

282
00:14:09,491 --> 00:14:10,188
I should go.

283
00:14:10,407 --> 00:14:11,448
Wait.

284
00:14:13,747 --> 00:14:14,825
Take my car.

285
00:14:15,613 --> 00:14:16,113
Huh?

286
00:14:16,113 --> 00:14:17,342
It'll probably be hard to get a ride in this area.

287
00:14:20,605 --> 00:14:23,674
Are you really going to lend your car
to a stranger this easily?

288
00:14:24,024 --> 00:14:24,829
What's your name?

289
00:14:26,471 --> 00:14:27,104
I'm Sand.

290
00:14:27,739 --> 00:14:28,406
I'm Pond.

291
00:14:29,851 --> 00:14:31,823
We're no longer strangers now.

292
00:14:33,268 --> 00:14:34,953
I have a class at 8:40 a.m. tomorrow.

293
00:14:35,172 --> 00:14:36,055
Come pick me up.

294
00:14:37,369 --> 00:14:37,873
See you.

295
00:14:43,763 --> 00:14:45,319
Don't forget to rub in some medicine.

296
00:14:46,173 --> 00:14:47,155
Good night.

297
00:15:00,683 --> 00:15:01,331
You can go.

298
00:15:04,331 --> 00:15:05,330
Hey, Arc.

299
00:15:06,009 --> 00:15:08,075
The other day, I asked you
to accept my friend's request

300
00:15:08,425 --> 00:15:09,499
Why haven't you?

301
00:15:12,920 --> 00:15:13,976
I guess I forgot.

302
00:15:14,939 --> 00:15:17,810
But you promised
that if I ate with you,

303
00:15:17,810 --> 00:15:18,851
you'd do it.

304
00:15:18,851 --> 00:15:20,089
Hurry up and accept her request.

305
00:15:20,089 --> 00:15:21,216
I will later.

306
00:15:21,216 --> 00:15:24,079
Do it now, or, I won't get out of the car.

307
00:15:26,006 --> 00:15:27,230
Come on. Do it.

308
00:15:30,229 --> 00:15:30,888
That's it.

309
00:15:32,640 --> 00:15:34,143
Done.

310
00:15:34,493 --> 00:15:35,250
Very good.

311
00:15:35,535 --> 00:15:36,420
I'm going now.

312
00:15:36,420 --> 00:15:37,102
Goodbye.

313
00:16:01,435 --> 00:16:02,218
Hey, Arc.

314
00:16:03,181 --> 00:16:04,331
Did you block me?

315
00:16:08,579 --> 00:16:09,204
Hey!

316
00:16:09,204 --> 00:16:10,585
Damn it!

317
00:16:11,880 --> 00:16:13,405
I'm getting fed up!

318
00:16:16,624 --> 00:16:17,602
Come in!

319
00:16:18,062 --> 00:16:19,192
I'm definitely coming in!

320
00:16:19,192 --> 00:16:21,069
I'm strolling in my tower.

321
00:16:21,069 --> 00:16:23,442
I'm running around in my tower. Whoa.

322
00:16:23,705 --> 00:16:24,407
Come on, Sand.

323
00:16:26,772 --> 00:16:27,700
Move, Po.

324
00:16:30,920 --> 00:16:31,574
Scary.

325
00:16:31,574 --> 00:16:32,200
Shit.

326
00:16:32,200 --> 00:16:32,992
What the hell?

327
00:16:33,189 --> 00:16:34,584
What are you doing down there?

328
00:16:34,584 --> 00:16:35,950
Why did you have to squeeze in like that?

329
00:16:39,563 --> 00:16:40,346
Hey, Arm.

330
00:16:43,762 --> 00:16:45,134
Did Arc block you on Instagram?

331
00:16:45,134 --> 00:16:45,682
Yes.

332
00:16:45,682 --> 00:16:47,642
I'm so freaking pissed!

333
00:16:49,766 --> 00:16:51,544
Arc is really independent, huh?

334
00:16:51,872 --> 00:16:54,298
Look, Sand, you need to know the difference

335
00:16:54,298 --> 00:16:55,760
between being independent and being a jerk.

336
00:16:55,760 --> 00:16:57,652
He's really getting on my nerves.

337
00:16:57,652 --> 00:16:58,170
Damn it.

338
00:16:58,170 --> 00:16:59,050
He's cursing right in my face.

339
00:16:59,532 --> 00:17:00,744
Why the hell did you ask him that?

340
00:17:06,920 --> 00:17:08,000
What the hell is this?

341
00:17:09,971 --> 00:17:10,624
What?

342
00:17:10,887 --> 00:17:12,600
He blocked you on IG
but sent you a friend request on Facebook?

343
00:17:13,095 --> 00:17:13,884
What's he up to?

344
00:17:14,234 --> 00:17:14,969
What should I do?

345
00:17:15,210 --> 00:17:16,454
Accept it.
What are you waiting for?

346
00:17:16,454 --> 00:17:17,317
I'll freaking deal with you!

347
00:17:17,317 --> 00:17:18,595
My friend will freaking deal with you!

348
00:17:20,215 --> 00:17:21,115
Which one?

349
00:17:21,115 --> 00:17:22,192
This one.

350
00:17:22,192 --> 00:17:22,994
- It's ugly.
- This one?

351
00:17:22,994 --> 00:17:23,759
Go ahead.

352
00:17:23,759 --> 00:17:24,360
Send it.

353
00:17:24,360 --> 00:17:25,052
Yes.

354
00:17:27,001 --> 00:17:28,288
What the hell is this thing?

355
00:17:28,857 --> 00:17:29,678
He's rude.

356
00:17:29,678 --> 00:17:31,126
Look at that foul mouth.

357
00:17:31,542 --> 00:17:34,289
YOU BLOCKED ME OVER THERE AND ADDED ME HERE.
DO YOU HAVE THAT MUCH FREE TIME?

358
00:17:34,289 --> 00:17:35,222
Yes, does he have that much free time?

359
00:17:35,222 --> 00:17:36,020
Yes. You better call him out.

360
00:17:36,020 --> 00:17:37,067
Do you have that much free time?

361
00:17:37,067 --> 00:17:37,727
Do you have that much free time?

362
00:17:37,727 --> 00:17:38,428
None of your business.

363
00:17:38,581 --> 00:17:39,713
Whoa. “None of your business”?

364
00:17:39,713 --> 00:17:40,343
Oh, look at him.

365
00:17:40,343 --> 00:17:40,958
Look at him.

366
00:17:40,958 --> 00:17:41,838
I need to calm down.

367
00:17:41,838 --> 00:17:42,621
I need to calm down.

368
00:17:43,059 --> 00:17:43,639
Calm down.

369
00:17:43,924 --> 00:17:44,664
Take a deep breath.

370
00:17:44,664 --> 00:17:46,324
Unblock me on IG already.

371
00:17:46,324 --> 00:17:47,428
I'm being nice.

372
00:17:47,428 --> 00:17:49,821
You're keeping your emotions in check.
You're being mature.

373
00:17:49,821 --> 00:17:50,645
I'll see about my mood.

374
00:17:50,645 --> 00:17:51,718
Whoa!

375
00:17:51,718 --> 00:17:52,866
“I'll see about my mood”?

376
00:17:52,866 --> 00:17:55,480
How dare he say he'll think about his mood?

377
00:17:55,480 --> 00:17:56,427
Take a deep breath.

378
00:17:57,100 --> 00:17:59,179
ACCEPT A-NGUN'S FRIEND REQUEST TOO.

379
00:17:59,179 --> 00:18:00,629
Be mature.

380
00:18:00,629 --> 00:18:01,848
If you talk about this again,

381
00:18:01,848 --> 00:18:02,549
I'll block you.

382
00:18:03,206 --> 00:18:04,461
Do I still have to keep calm?

383
00:18:04,461 --> 00:18:05,379
I can't keep calm anymore.

384
00:18:05,379 --> 00:18:06,121
Calm down.

385
00:18:06,121 --> 00:18:07,161
He's threatening you.

386
00:18:07,161 --> 00:18:08,553
That's a threat.

387
00:18:08,750 --> 00:18:09,875
BUT YOU PROMISED ME!

388
00:18:09,875 --> 00:18:10,642
Keep calling him out.

389
00:18:10,642 --> 00:18:13,096
BESIDES, WHAT'S SO HARD ABOUT
ACCEPTING A FRIEND REQUEST?!

390
00:18:16,950 --> 00:18:18,071
Press send.

391
00:18:18,268 --> 00:18:19,594
I already did. Why isn't it sending?

392
00:18:19,594 --> 00:18:20,670
Maybe the internet isn't working?

393
00:18:21,918 --> 00:18:22,679
I know what this is.

394
00:18:23,730 --> 00:18:25,169
He blocked you.

395
00:18:26,767 --> 00:18:28,460
Shit.

396
00:18:28,460 --> 00:18:29,643
Damn it!

397
00:18:29,643 --> 00:18:31,632
You're really getting on my nerves!

398
00:18:33,143 --> 00:18:34,444
What's the hospital number?

399
00:18:34,444 --> 00:18:35,298
Call the hospital.

400
00:18:35,298 --> 00:18:37,091
You guys are getting on my nerves!

401
00:18:37,091 --> 00:18:37,768
Damn it!

402
00:18:43,723 --> 00:18:44,786
Stop it, Sand!

403
00:18:44,880 --> 00:18:45,380
Not yet!

404
00:18:45,380 --> 00:18:45,882
Let me handle it.

405
00:18:46,210 --> 00:18:47,960
You made me lose.
Seriously, Sand.

406
00:18:47,960 --> 00:18:48,592
Y'all,

407
00:18:48,592 --> 00:18:50,351
the teacher said today's class is canceled.

408
00:18:50,351 --> 00:18:51,501
Oh.

409
00:18:51,501 --> 00:18:52,984
He might as well tell us tomorrow.

410
00:18:52,984 --> 00:18:53,794
Damn it!

411
00:18:53,794 --> 00:18:55,959
What was the point of coming early?

412
00:18:56,222 --> 00:18:58,333
So you can go back to sleep at the dorm.

413
00:18:58,333 --> 00:18:58,860
Get up.

414
00:18:59,583 --> 00:19:00,470
Let's head back to the dorm and sleep.

415
00:19:00,470 --> 00:19:00,970
I'm so annoyed.

416
00:19:08,078 --> 00:19:10,954
I don't think our motorbike could get us back.

417
00:19:11,151 --> 00:19:12,476
We're so unlucky.

418
00:19:12,920 --> 00:19:13,571
Sand.

419
00:19:13,571 --> 00:19:14,264
Yeah?

420
00:19:14,264 --> 00:19:16,904
Do you still have that anonymous luxury car?

421
00:19:16,904 --> 00:19:18,040
Oh, I already returned it.

422
00:19:18,040 --> 00:19:21,411
Will you tell us who it belongs to already?

423
00:19:21,411 --> 00:19:22,550
Yeah, whose car is that?

424
00:19:23,119 --> 00:19:24,077
Oh, it's…

425
00:19:24,077 --> 00:19:24,920
It's a long story.

426
00:19:24,920 --> 00:19:25,611
I knew it.

427
00:19:25,611 --> 00:19:26,881
- You knew it well.
- A long story, huh?

428
00:19:26,881 --> 00:19:27,542
You don't need to know.

429
00:19:27,695 --> 00:19:29,561
Let's go to the cafe near the Faculty of Agriculture.

430
00:19:29,561 --> 00:19:30,061
Come on.

431
00:19:30,061 --> 00:19:31,870
We can talk about your long story there.

432
00:19:31,870 --> 00:19:32,432
Let's go.

433
00:19:35,519 --> 00:19:36,142
Ouch!

434
00:19:36,142 --> 00:19:36,642
Damn it!

435
00:19:36,642 --> 00:19:37,297
Arm, watch your steps!

436
00:19:37,297 --> 00:19:38,281
Where should we go?

437
00:19:38,281 --> 00:19:38,854
Yeah.

438
00:19:39,905 --> 00:19:41,104
Oh, shit!

439
00:19:41,695 --> 00:19:42,819
Run!

440
00:19:43,038 --> 00:19:43,845
Shit!

441
00:19:43,845 --> 00:19:45,170
It's raining!

442
00:19:45,170 --> 00:19:45,670
Run!

443
00:19:45,670 --> 00:19:46,170
It's a storm!

444
00:19:46,170 --> 00:19:49,503
It's raining!

445
00:19:50,707 --> 00:19:51,761
It's raining!

446
00:19:52,068 --> 00:19:52,837
It's raining!

447
00:19:53,757 --> 00:19:54,399
It's raining!

448
00:19:55,910 --> 00:19:57,048
Damn it!

449
00:19:58,320 --> 00:19:59,545
It hurts so much!

450
00:19:59,545 --> 00:20:00,171
It hurts!

451
00:20:00,171 --> 00:20:01,261
Because of my muscles.

452
00:20:01,261 --> 00:20:02,006
Hey.

453
00:20:02,115 --> 00:20:03,374
Is that your peer mentor's mentor?

454
00:20:10,271 --> 00:20:11,552
Not anymore.

455
00:20:12,428 --> 00:20:14,661
I cut him off from my group.

456
00:20:15,121 --> 00:20:16,082
That's so cool.

457
00:20:18,031 --> 00:20:18,699
Arm.

458
00:20:25,705 --> 00:20:26,881
Why did you go out in the rain and get soaked?

459
00:20:27,406 --> 00:20:28,798
Who are you talking to?

460
00:20:30,353 --> 00:20:31,959
Do we know each other?

461
00:20:35,243 --> 00:20:35,796
Come on, Arm.

462
00:20:35,796 --> 00:20:36,645
What?

463
00:20:36,920 --> 00:20:38,188
We blocked each other.

464
00:20:39,305 --> 00:20:41,902
I don't talk to strangers.

465
00:20:44,920 --> 00:20:45,574
Fine.

466
00:20:46,253 --> 00:20:47,621
You want to be like this?

467
00:20:50,467 --> 00:20:51,464
Hey.

468
00:20:51,464 --> 00:20:54,536
Can anyone tell this sulky kid

469
00:20:54,711 --> 00:20:57,241
to take care of himself when it's raining

470
00:20:57,241 --> 00:20:58,131
so he doesn't get a cold?

471
00:21:00,400 --> 00:21:01,969
If you get sick,

472
00:21:02,407 --> 00:21:03,642
I'll kick you.

473
00:21:04,496 --> 00:21:05,143
Got it?

474
00:21:08,909 --> 00:21:10,119
Please take it from here, guys.

475
00:21:14,848 --> 00:21:16,583
Don't get a cold from the rain

476
00:21:16,583 --> 00:21:17,967
or he'll kick you.

477
00:21:18,164 --> 00:21:19,544
He didn't ask you to say that!

478
00:21:19,544 --> 00:21:20,287
Po!

479
00:21:20,834 --> 00:21:21,802
Help me!

480
00:21:28,765 --> 00:21:29,809
What are you daydreaming about?

481
00:21:33,028 --> 00:21:35,339
Are you thinking about your peer mentor's mentor?

482
00:21:35,492 --> 00:21:36,259
Hmm?

483
00:21:38,230 --> 00:21:39,018
Yes!

484
00:21:39,368 --> 00:21:43,120
I was thinking that if I see him again,
what should I curse at him?

485
00:21:43,251 --> 00:21:43,850
Damn it.

486
00:21:44,594 --> 00:21:45,442
Hey, Arm.

487
00:21:45,661 --> 00:21:48,186
He did all that because he's worried about you.

488
00:21:48,383 --> 00:21:49,083
Yeah.

489
00:21:51,771 --> 00:21:53,398
More like he was trying to get on my nerves.

490
00:21:53,595 --> 00:21:54,710
Didn't you see that?

491
00:21:56,133 --> 00:21:56,734
Oh.

492
00:21:58,267 --> 00:22:00,377
If I didn't know you and Arc hate each other,

493
00:22:00,574 --> 00:22:01,602
I'd think

494
00:22:01,930 --> 00:22:03,260
he's hitting on you.

495
00:22:04,377 --> 00:22:05,382
True.

496
00:22:06,745 --> 00:22:08,277
Hitting on me, my ass!

497
00:22:08,693 --> 00:22:09,658
If this is how he's hitting on me,

498
00:22:09,855 --> 00:22:11,208
I'd rather die single.

499
00:22:11,317 --> 00:22:11,817
Damn it!

500
00:22:11,817 --> 00:22:12,544
You're acting all strong now.

501
00:22:12,544 --> 00:22:13,164
Yeah.

502
00:22:16,383 --> 00:22:17,164
This is hot!

503
00:22:18,193 --> 00:22:19,194
Why didn't you tell me it's hot?

504
00:22:19,194 --> 00:22:19,998
How would I know that?

505
00:22:20,195 --> 00:22:21,202
We're drinking cold drinks.

506
00:22:21,662 --> 00:22:22,955
Cheers.

507
00:22:30,179 --> 00:22:30,883
What are you looking at?

508
00:22:31,408 --> 00:22:32,229
That looks good.

509
00:22:32,754 --> 00:22:33,398
The food?

510
00:22:36,113 --> 00:22:37,020
Hey, Arm!

511
00:22:37,896 --> 00:22:38,521
Hey.

512
00:22:39,265 --> 00:22:40,132
Hi, Pun. Hi, Jet.

513
00:22:40,132 --> 00:22:41,096
Hi.

514
00:22:41,096 --> 00:22:42,040
Come sit with us.

515
00:22:42,215 --> 00:22:43,157
Where are your friends?

516
00:22:44,208 --> 00:22:45,387
They're in the cheering activities.

517
00:22:45,869 --> 00:22:48,154
I'm waiting to leave with them,
so I came here to eat.

518
00:22:48,439 --> 00:22:49,562
You're not joining the cheering activities?

519
00:22:49,562 --> 00:22:50,831
Then you won't get your gear.

520
00:22:52,605 --> 00:22:53,765
You can just buy it.

521
00:22:53,765 --> 00:22:54,897
I bought mine too.

522
00:22:56,802 --> 00:22:57,522
Hey!

523
00:23:12,521 --> 00:23:14,227
Hey! Seriously, Arc?

524
00:23:15,360 --> 00:23:16,477
Tell me honestly.

525
00:23:16,762 --> 00:23:18,614
Why do you keep physically abusing me?

526
00:23:19,139 --> 00:23:20,146
You call this physical abuse?

527
00:23:20,146 --> 00:23:20,844
You hurt me.

528
00:23:20,844 --> 00:23:22,349
It's called physical abuse.

529
00:23:22,787 --> 00:23:23,822
Did that hurt already?

530
00:23:23,822 --> 00:23:25,553
I'm more fragile than you think.

531
00:23:25,553 --> 00:23:26,440
So,

532
00:23:26,440 --> 00:23:27,857
don't be rough with me again.

533
00:23:27,857 --> 00:23:28,427
Got it?

534
00:23:30,441 --> 00:23:31,659
Your whole body is fragile,

535
00:23:32,338 --> 00:23:33,389
except your face.

536
00:23:33,564 --> 00:23:34,094
Hey!

537
00:23:34,860 --> 00:23:35,771
Guys, look at him!

538
00:23:35,771 --> 00:23:36,723
Calm down.

539
00:23:36,920 --> 00:23:37,991
Don't fight.

540
00:23:38,626 --> 00:23:40,221
Just say you're worried about him.

541
00:23:40,703 --> 00:23:42,284
Why are you being so tight-lipped?

542
00:23:44,561 --> 00:23:45,117
Hey.

543
00:23:46,240 --> 00:23:47,627
What do you do
when your senior gives you something?

544
00:23:47,846 --> 00:23:48,892
I didn't ask for it.

545
00:23:49,680 --> 00:23:50,616
Arm.

546
00:23:56,747 --> 00:23:57,630
Thank you.

547
00:24:00,892 --> 00:24:01,392
Sir.

548
00:24:04,173 --> 00:24:06,592
Hey, I just remember

549
00:24:06,767 --> 00:24:08,949
I forgot to bring you my lecture notes again.

550
00:24:08,949 --> 00:24:09,889
Sorry.

551
00:24:11,203 --> 00:24:12,336
It's totally fine.

552
00:24:12,445 --> 00:24:14,441
You can bring it whenever it suits you.

553
00:24:14,791 --> 00:24:16,390
I haven't really been taking care of you.

554
00:24:16,390 --> 00:24:17,372
I feel bad.

555
00:24:17,503 --> 00:24:18,465
Don't worry.

556
00:24:18,465 --> 00:24:19,143
It's chill.

557
00:24:20,106 --> 00:24:21,138
I have an idea.

558
00:24:21,357 --> 00:24:25,779
Since I took care of Yeepun for you
for a long time,

559
00:24:26,020 --> 00:24:29,673
you should take care of Arm
to return the favor.

560
00:24:29,673 --> 00:24:30,317
Uh…

561
00:24:30,405 --> 00:24:30,929
Jet…

562
00:24:30,929 --> 00:24:32,253
Great idea, babe.

563
00:24:32,581 --> 00:24:35,291
That way, I won't have to worry about you
or feel bad.

564
00:24:36,430 --> 00:24:39,085
About the lecture notes,
you can borrow Arc's.

565
00:24:39,589 --> 00:24:42,413
His notes are so amazing, you know?

566
00:24:44,581 --> 00:24:47,762
Well, Jet, I think…

567
00:24:47,915 --> 00:24:49,540
Then come and get them today.

568
00:24:50,480 --> 00:24:52,054
I was just planning to clear my room.

569
00:24:53,280 --> 00:24:53,961
Let's go.

570
00:24:54,049 --> 00:24:54,693
Get up.

571
00:24:54,920 --> 00:24:55,640
Hey.

572
00:24:56,165 --> 00:24:57,145
I haven't even eaten.

573
00:24:57,233 --> 00:24:57,757
Get up!

574
00:24:57,910 --> 00:24:58,765
Let me have one bite.

575
00:24:58,765 --> 00:24:59,277
Arm!

576
00:24:59,759 --> 00:25:00,905
Hurry up!

577
00:25:01,080 --> 00:25:01,717
Let's go!

578
00:25:02,330 --> 00:25:03,150
My bag!

579
00:25:30,689 --> 00:25:31,245
Hey.

580
00:25:32,690 --> 00:25:34,012
What are you so excited about?

581
00:25:35,391 --> 00:25:36,241
Nothing.

582
00:25:38,036 --> 00:25:39,061
Where are your lecture notes?

583
00:25:39,433 --> 00:25:40,189
Hurry up and give them to me.

584
00:25:40,189 --> 00:25:40,814
I don't know.

585
00:25:40,946 --> 00:25:41,446
What?

586
00:25:41,731 --> 00:25:42,961
My room is big.

587
00:25:43,486 --> 00:25:44,673
It'll take a while to find them.

588
00:25:45,636 --> 00:25:46,197
Where are they?

589
00:25:46,197 --> 00:25:47,028
I can help you look.

590
00:25:49,918 --> 00:25:50,683
Have you taken any medicine?

591
00:25:52,259 --> 00:25:52,853
No.

592
00:26:13,875 --> 00:26:14,375
Here.

593
00:26:14,703 --> 00:26:15,563
Hey!

594
00:26:16,636 --> 00:26:17,657
What are you doing?

595
00:26:17,920 --> 00:26:18,972
Feeding you medicine.

596
00:26:19,716 --> 00:26:20,521
Hey!

597
00:26:20,609 --> 00:26:22,102
What kind of method is this?

598
00:26:23,022 --> 00:26:23,916
It's how I give medicine to a dog.

599
00:26:24,617 --> 00:26:25,429
I've never fed medicine to a human before.

600
00:26:25,429 --> 00:26:25,968
Here.

601
00:26:25,968 --> 00:26:26,734
Hey!

602
00:26:26,931 --> 00:26:27,559
Hey!

603
00:26:28,500 --> 00:26:29,578
Do I look like a dog?

604
00:26:29,578 --> 00:26:30,254
Give it to me.

605
00:26:30,254 --> 00:26:30,932
I can take it by myself.

606
00:26:31,654 --> 00:26:32,306
Seriously.

607
00:26:39,291 --> 00:26:40,127
Are you happy now?

608
00:26:41,879 --> 00:26:43,057
Where are your notes?

609
00:26:43,188 --> 00:26:44,288
Stop wasting time.

610
00:26:46,631 --> 00:26:47,650
After I take a shower.

611
00:26:57,410 --> 00:26:59,260
Why the hell are you stalling?

612
00:28:32,111 --> 00:28:33,170
Where is he?

613
00:28:35,120 --> 00:28:36,951
Should we report this to the police yet?

614
00:28:36,951 --> 00:28:38,222
Don't panic.

615
00:28:41,424 --> 00:28:42,293
Is everything alright?

616
00:28:43,355 --> 00:28:43,965
Hey, Pond.

617
00:28:43,965 --> 00:28:45,013
Arm is missing.

618
00:28:45,013 --> 00:28:46,241
Huh? Missing?

619
00:28:46,241 --> 00:28:48,024
Yes. He didn't join the cheering activities.

620
00:28:48,024 --> 00:28:50,256
Normally, the three of us always leave together,

621
00:28:50,256 --> 00:28:51,442
but he's not picking up his phone.

622
00:28:51,442 --> 00:28:52,840
We don't know if he's dead or alive.

623
00:28:52,840 --> 00:28:54,112
He's usually dumb.

624
00:28:55,812 --> 00:28:57,904
Says the one who told me not to panic.

625
00:28:57,904 --> 00:28:58,449
Stay out of it.

626
00:28:58,449 --> 00:28:59,164
Fine.

627
00:29:00,333 --> 00:29:00,951
Calm down.

628
00:29:01,194 --> 00:29:02,629
I might have an idea where your friend is.

629
00:29:02,629 --> 00:29:03,852
Let me find out for sure.

630
00:29:04,489 --> 00:29:05,459
Okay. Please help us.

631
00:29:06,218 --> 00:29:08,503
Should we actually call the police?

632
00:29:09,520 --> 00:29:10,825
I think we should.

633
00:29:14,650 --> 00:29:15,257
Yeah.

634
00:29:16,213 --> 00:29:17,217
I'll give him a ride when he wakes up.

635
00:29:19,737 --> 00:29:20,930
I have to go.

636
00:29:28,079 --> 00:29:29,734
That medicine could've put an elephant to sleep.

637
00:29:30,705 --> 00:29:32,346
My head feels so heavy.

638
00:29:33,348 --> 00:29:34,154
If you're sleepy, just sleep.

639
00:29:35,120 --> 00:29:35,620
Oh.

640
00:29:37,548 --> 00:29:38,256
No.

641
00:29:39,182 --> 00:29:40,491
Have you found the lecture notes?

642
00:29:43,527 --> 00:29:45,097
Do you hate being around me that much?

643
00:29:49,620 --> 00:29:50,427
Why do you ask that?

644
00:29:52,142 --> 00:29:52,784
I don't know.

645
00:29:53,664 --> 00:29:55,559
It seems like you're always
trying to get away from me.

646
00:29:57,760 --> 00:29:59,211
Because you always get on my nerves.

647
00:30:06,251 --> 00:30:07,671
Then tell me how you want me to approach you.

648
00:30:11,860 --> 00:30:12,433
What?

649
00:30:19,035 --> 00:30:19,535
Here.

650
00:30:19,763 --> 00:30:21,053
I only found two subjects.

651
00:30:21,660 --> 00:30:22,758
Once I find the rest, I'll give them to you.

652
00:30:24,655 --> 00:30:25,401
Thank you.

653
00:30:25,629 --> 00:30:26,407
I should go.

654
00:30:26,680 --> 00:30:27,530
I'll give you a ride.

655
00:30:27,840 --> 00:30:28,604
No need.

656
00:30:28,756 --> 00:30:29,474
It's just nearby.

657
00:30:30,946 --> 00:30:32,146
Pun asked me to take care of you.

658
00:30:32,404 --> 00:30:33,229
Are you confused?

659
00:30:33,624 --> 00:30:35,796
Oh, just forget it.

660
00:30:35,796 --> 00:30:37,003
Pun won't find out.

661
00:30:37,003 --> 00:30:38,060
It's late. Just go to bed.

662
00:30:38,060 --> 00:30:38,662
I'm leaving.

663
00:30:38,783 --> 00:30:39,283
Hey.

664
00:30:41,681 --> 00:30:42,433
Don't be stubborn.

665
00:30:46,258 --> 00:30:46,873
Fine.

666
00:30:56,126 --> 00:30:56,800
Thank you, Pond.

667
00:30:56,800 --> 00:30:57,431
No worries.

668
00:30:57,431 --> 00:30:57,983
Thank you.

669
00:31:06,134 --> 00:31:06,634
Shit!

670
00:31:07,256 --> 00:31:08,492
I left the key with Arm!

671
00:31:08,689 --> 00:31:09,189
What?

672
00:31:09,781 --> 00:31:10,426
Shit.

673
00:31:11,094 --> 00:31:13,578
You can hang out in my room for now.

674
00:31:13,760 --> 00:31:15,323
I'd rather not.

675
00:31:15,581 --> 00:31:17,307
Your roommate is as strict as a dog.

676
00:31:17,504 --> 00:31:18,477
Come on.

677
00:31:18,598 --> 00:31:21,484
He might be strict
but he's not that scary.

678
00:31:22,045 --> 00:31:24,298
Next time, don't sleep in my room.

679
00:31:24,298 --> 00:31:24,903
Fine.

680
00:31:24,903 --> 00:31:26,204
I'll wait for Arm with you.

681
00:31:26,841 --> 00:31:27,730
It's okay, Po.

682
00:31:28,018 --> 00:31:28,934
I'll stay with him.

683
00:31:29,268 --> 00:31:30,957
I want to talk to Arc.

684
00:31:35,120 --> 00:31:35,837
You can go.

685
00:31:35,837 --> 00:31:36,860
I'll wait for Arm.

686
00:31:36,860 --> 00:31:37,907
You're sending me away that easily?

687
00:31:39,258 --> 00:31:39,865
Go upstairs.

688
00:31:40,836 --> 00:31:41,698
Watch your steps.

689
00:31:42,047 --> 00:31:42,683
Okay.

690
00:31:42,683 --> 00:31:43,241
Yeah.

691
00:31:44,455 --> 00:31:45,632
What? Why are you looking at me?

692
00:31:45,632 --> 00:31:46,223
Just go.

693
00:31:55,374 --> 00:31:57,548
It's late so not many places are open.

694
00:31:58,292 --> 00:31:58,873
Can you eat this?

695
00:31:59,374 --> 00:31:59,874
Sure.

696
00:32:01,073 --> 00:32:01,912
If you can,
then eat.

697
00:32:02,240 --> 00:32:02,812
!@#$.

698
00:32:08,382 --> 00:32:08,882
What?

699
00:32:09,838 --> 00:32:10,471
!@#$

700
00:32:12,535 --> 00:32:13,035
!@#$

701
00:32:13,339 --> 00:32:13,839
!@#$

702
00:32:14,522 --> 00:32:15,040
Huh?

703
00:32:15,192 --> 00:32:15,984
!@#$

704
00:32:16,409 --> 00:32:16,909
Huh?

705
00:32:16,909 --> 00:32:17,409
!@#$

706
00:32:17,409 --> 00:32:18,219
Oh, it's hot.

707
00:32:18,826 --> 00:32:19,673
Drink some water.

708
00:32:27,759 --> 00:32:28,411
Thanks, I guess.

709
00:32:29,094 --> 00:32:29,594
I'm going now.

710
00:32:34,481 --> 00:32:35,850
See you tomorrow at the cinema.

711
00:32:37,277 --> 00:32:37,777
Okay.

712
00:32:39,960 --> 00:32:40,574
Oh.

713
00:32:45,917 --> 00:32:47,001
Ahem.

714
00:32:47,441 --> 00:32:48,520
Ahem.

715
00:32:49,598 --> 00:32:50,625
Where have you been?

716
00:32:50,883 --> 00:32:52,084
Your friends were worried sick.

717
00:32:53,374 --> 00:32:54,546
That's my business.

718
00:32:54,546 --> 00:32:55,242
Stay out of it.

719
00:33:01,256 --> 00:33:02,320
Hey, Pond.

720
00:33:02,532 --> 00:33:03,787
What are you doing here?

721
00:33:07,339 --> 00:33:09,099
Don't you want to talk to Arc?

722
00:33:09,539 --> 00:33:10,622
Oh, not anymore.

723
00:33:10,622 --> 00:33:11,677
I'll just call him later.

724
00:33:12,040 --> 00:33:12,677
See you around.

725
00:33:12,677 --> 00:33:13,177
Yeah.

726
00:33:13,177 --> 00:33:14,120
Then why did you…?

727
00:33:14,257 --> 00:33:15,293
I have to go. I'm in a hurry.

728
00:33:18,162 --> 00:33:19,408
- What are you up to?
- What are you up to?

729
00:33:19,408 --> 00:33:19,908
Tell me what you're up to.

730
00:33:19,908 --> 00:33:20,408
What's going on with you?

731
00:33:20,408 --> 00:33:20,908
Something's up with you.

732
00:33:20,999 --> 00:33:21,583
Nothing's going on with me.

733
00:33:21,583 --> 00:33:22,203
Don't try to put this on me.

734
00:33:22,203 --> 00:33:23,277
Where have you been for so long?

735
00:33:23,277 --> 00:33:23,904
And you didn't think to tell us.

736
00:33:23,904 --> 00:33:24,514
What was he doing here?

737
00:33:24,514 --> 00:33:25,583
How come he dropped you off in front of the dorm?

738
00:33:25,583 --> 00:33:26,692
No, he was waiting for him.

739
00:33:26,692 --> 00:33:27,579
Nothing's going on with me.

740
00:33:27,685 --> 00:33:29,425
Tell me about you guys.

741
00:33:51,965 --> 00:33:53,541
DON'T FORGET TO TAKE YOUR MEDICINE AGAIN
BEFORE YOU SLEEP.

742
00:33:57,973 --> 00:34:00,456
IF YOU DON'T LIKE MY REPLY,
WILL YOU BLOCK ME AGAIN?

743
00:34:01,746 --> 00:34:03,654
I WON'T IF YOU DON'T GET ON MY NERVES.

744
00:34:06,796 --> 00:34:09,247
THEN I'LL GET ON YOUR NERVES.
I WANT TO BE BLOCKED.

745
00:34:10,188 --> 00:34:13,135
ARM, DON'T MAKE ME STUFF THE MEDICINE
IN YOUR MOUTH.

746
00:34:13,469 --> 00:34:14,663
HOW SCARY.

747
00:34:15,240 --> 00:34:17,303
WILL YOU DIE IF YOU STOP GETTING ON MY NERVES
FOR 1 SECOND?

748
00:34:19,747 --> 00:34:20,327
ANSWER.

749
00:34:22,725 --> 00:34:24,192
ARM! WHERE ARE YOU?

750
00:34:24,511 --> 00:34:25,250
ANSWER ME.

751
00:34:26,616 --> 00:34:28,015
I WAS JUST TRYING NOT TO GET ON YOUR NERVES.

752
00:34:28,425 --> 00:34:30,135
DAMN, I ALMOST DIED.

753
00:34:32,047 --> 00:34:33,120
YOU'RE SAYING RUDE THINGS AGAIN.

754
00:34:34,274 --> 00:34:35,385
I'M TYPING.

755
00:34:36,615 --> 00:34:38,081
SEND ME A PHOTO OF YOU TAKING YOUR MEDICINE.

756
00:35:01,000 --> 00:35:01,500
OKAY.

757
00:35:02,912 --> 00:35:04,628
ARE YOU WORRIED ABOUT ME?

758
00:35:09,182 --> 00:35:11,617
I JUST DON'T WANT YOU TO SPREAD GERMS

Hi, Pun.

766
00:35:44,960 --> 00:35:46,257
I'm waiting in front of my dorm.

767
00:35:46,503 --> 00:35:47,456
Okay.

768
00:35:47,636 --> 00:35:48,495
I'll tell Arc.

769
00:35:51,805 --> 00:35:52,860
Why are you telling him?

770
00:35:52,860 --> 00:35:55,362
Arc is going to pick you up.

771
00:35:55,788 --> 00:35:56,778
I'll go with Jet.

772
00:35:56,942 --> 00:35:57,762
See you at the mall.

773
00:36:15,440 --> 00:36:16,060
Damn it.

774
00:36:24,088 --> 00:36:25,474
Won't you greet your senior?

775
00:36:28,407 --> 00:36:30,527
Hi, Senior Arc.

776
00:36:33,263 --> 00:36:33,976
This is weird.

777
00:36:35,565 --> 00:36:36,249
What's weird?

778
00:36:39,640 --> 00:36:40,673
You're being a good kid, which is unusual.

779
00:36:42,180 --> 00:36:43,711
What are you talking about?

780
00:36:44,153 --> 00:36:45,094
I'm a grown-up.

781
00:36:45,094 --> 00:36:46,656
We're only two years apart.

782
00:36:47,655 --> 00:36:48,317
Let's go.

783
00:37:15,075 --> 00:37:15,604
Have we arrived?

784
00:37:16,554 --> 00:37:17,318
Sit tight.

785
00:37:19,972 --> 00:37:21,179
Hey, calm down, Arc.

786
00:37:21,179 --> 00:37:21,679
Hey.

787
00:37:21,679 --> 00:37:22,816
That car cut me off first.

788
00:37:23,979 --> 00:37:25,079
Arc! It's dangerous.

789
00:37:25,079 --> 00:37:25,579
Calm down.

790
00:37:25,579 --> 00:37:26,079
Arm,

791
00:37:26,800 --> 00:37:27,591
grab my phone.

792
00:37:28,967 --> 00:37:29,529
Why?

793
00:37:29,529 --> 00:37:30,509
We're going to call insurance soon.

794
00:37:30,722 --> 00:37:31,222
Arc!

795
00:37:33,123 --> 00:37:33,764
Arc!

796
00:37:34,763 --> 00:37:35,263
Arc!

797
00:37:44,553 --> 00:37:45,053
Arm.

798
00:37:51,164 --> 00:37:51,819
Arm.

799
00:37:55,604 --> 00:37:56,104
Arm.

800
00:37:56,972 --> 00:37:57,619
Arm!

801
00:37:58,717 --> 00:37:59,277
Arm!

802
00:37:59,621 --> 00:38:00,432
Are you alright?

803
00:38:03,280 --> 00:38:04,537
Answer me!

804
00:38:06,782 --> 00:38:07,379
I'm fine.

805
00:38:12,376 --> 00:38:13,135
Are you hurt?

806
00:38:25,156 --> 00:38:26,998
Are either of you hurt?

807
00:38:26,998 --> 00:38:28,218
Arm has a scratch.

808
00:38:28,300 --> 00:38:29,067
He's bleeding too.

809
00:38:29,493 --> 00:38:31,610
Calm down, Arc.

810
00:38:32,036 --> 00:38:33,267
Pun and I are coming right away.

811
00:38:34,725 --> 00:38:35,578
What did he say?

812
00:38:35,971 --> 00:38:36,897
Are they hurt?

813
00:38:38,027 --> 00:38:38,961
From what I heard,

814
00:38:39,354 --> 00:38:40,652
I don't think they're badly injured.

815
00:38:44,240 --> 00:38:47,535
I hope this time, Arc learns to be more patient.

816
00:38:48,256 --> 00:38:48,851
Yeah,

817
00:38:49,900 --> 00:38:51,223
from how he sounds,

818
00:38:51,747 --> 00:38:54,867
I think he'll stop being hot-headed for good.

819
00:39:13,603 --> 00:39:14,381
Are you alright?

820
00:39:15,987 --> 00:39:16,646
I'm fine now.

821
00:39:17,301 --> 00:39:18,734
Just a little shocked.

822
00:39:21,080 --> 00:39:21,612
Okay.

823
00:39:23,037 --> 00:39:23,537
That's good.

824
00:39:24,127 --> 00:39:25,074
What about you?

825
00:39:26,254 --> 00:39:27,083
Are you hurt?

826
00:39:42,780 --> 00:39:43,564
I'm sorry.

827
00:39:49,145 --> 00:39:49,645
Hey.

828
00:39:52,660 --> 00:39:53,231
Arc.

829
00:39:54,607 --> 00:39:55,784
I'm really fine now.

830
00:40:09,864 --> 00:40:10,371
Arc.

831
00:40:13,140 --> 00:40:13,661
Hey.

832
00:40:15,136 --> 00:40:16,124
Look at me.

833
00:40:24,276 --> 00:40:25,650
I'm really fine now.

834
00:40:26,715 --> 00:40:27,611
Is something wrong?

835
00:40:28,626 --> 00:40:29,462
I'm just worried about you.

836
00:40:37,500 --> 00:40:38,536
I'm really fine now.

837
00:40:39,257 --> 00:40:40,236
It's just a small scratch.

838
00:40:40,744 --> 00:40:42,442
It's far from my heart.

839
00:41:01,679 --> 00:41:02,825
I promised...

840
00:41:05,053 --> 00:41:06,843
I'd take the best care of you.

841
00:41:07,138 --> 00:41:07,638
Huh?

842
00:41:07,720 --> 00:41:09,242
But I hurt you myself.

843
00:41:09,668 --> 00:41:12,010
Who did you promise?

844
00:41:12,440 --> 00:41:13,650
I promise you now.

845
00:41:22,270 --> 00:41:23,114
From now on,

846
00:41:25,277 --> 00:41:26,728
I'll take the best care of you.

857
00:41:59,647 --> 00:42:00,953
he hurt him.

858
00:42:00,953 --> 00:42:01,625
Oh.

859
00:42:01,822 --> 00:42:03,428
Is it the scratch Arm posted on his story?

860
00:42:03,674 --> 00:42:04,309
What story?

861
00:42:04,309 --> 00:42:06,238
