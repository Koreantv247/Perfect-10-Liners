1
00:00:00,180 --> 00:00:01,306
When will you move out of the on-campus dorm?

2
00:00:01,742 --> 00:00:02,758
I’m looking for a place right now.

3
00:00:02,890 --> 00:00:03,954
My condo is still available.

4
00:00:04,400 --> 00:00:05,120
In case you're interested.

5
00:00:05,539 --> 00:00:07,663
You’re the most important to me.

6
00:00:08,011 --> 00:00:09,807
Maybe I’m meant to be yours alone.

7
00:00:11,257 --> 00:00:11,915
Arc.

8
00:00:12,376 --> 00:00:13,979
I lost your jacket.

9
00:00:14,029 --> 00:00:15,871
I lost it.

10
00:00:16,077 --> 00:00:17,428
Though my jacket is gone,

11
00:00:17,634 --> 00:00:18,893
I’m still here with you.

12
00:00:19,979 --> 00:00:20,817
Sorry

13
00:00:21,601 --> 00:00:22,817
for keeping you waiting so long.

14
00:00:23,623 --> 00:00:24,851
I love you already.

15
00:00:26,589 --> 00:00:27,358
Let’s go out.

16
00:00:27,677 --> 00:00:29,139
I thought we’d been dating for a long time.

17
00:00:33,780 --> 00:00:34,444
Yotha.

18
00:00:35,985 --> 00:00:36,642
Yotha.

19
00:00:38,044 --> 00:00:39,801
If you don’t open the door, I’m coming in.

20
00:00:46,240 --> 00:00:47,245
Yotha!

21
00:00:48,262 --> 00:00:49,554
What’s wrong with you?

22
00:00:50,081 --> 00:00:50,705
What do you want?

23
00:00:50,739 --> 00:00:52,142
Go to the dorm with me.

24
00:00:52,391 --> 00:00:53,173
Why?

25
00:00:53,291 --> 00:00:54,592
You’re going there tomorrow anyway.

26
00:00:55,176 --> 00:00:56,521
Just to look around.

27
00:00:57,885 --> 00:00:58,795
I’m not going.

28
00:01:00,004 --> 00:01:00,517
You are!

29
00:01:01,682 --> 00:01:02,511
What the hell, Fai?

30
00:01:02,582 --> 00:01:03,228
I’m not going!

31
00:01:03,946 --> 00:01:04,493
You are!

32
00:01:04,771 --> 00:01:05,474
I’m not!

33
00:01:06,183 --> 00:01:06,674
You are!

34
00:01:06,882 --> 00:01:07,712
No! I want to sleep!

35
00:01:07,733 --> 00:01:09,168
I said you’re coming with me!

36
00:01:09,309 --> 00:01:10,262
Fai, you jerk!

37
00:01:10,428 --> 00:01:11,120
I’m not going!

38
00:01:11,900 --> 00:01:14,438
Ouch! Fai, you’re hurting me.

39
00:01:15,720 --> 00:01:16,749
Mom is coming today.

40
00:01:20,145 --> 00:01:21,031
Let me take a shower then.

41
00:03:14,019 --> 00:03:14,795
Hey, Arc.

42
00:03:16,112 --> 00:03:18,703
I already told Mom I’m moving in with you.

43
00:03:19,771 --> 00:03:22,271
Isn’t she confused about why you’re living
with a senior in your group?

44
00:03:22,665 --> 00:03:23,162
No.

45
00:03:23,650 --> 00:03:26,182
I told her I was moving in with my boyfriend.

46
00:03:28,790 --> 00:03:29,642
Did you really say that?

47
00:03:30,069 --> 00:03:30,598
Yes.

48
00:03:30,644 --> 00:03:31,737
She said it’s a good thing

49
00:03:32,122 --> 00:03:33,223
that I don’t have to pay for my dorm.

50
00:03:33,617 --> 00:03:35,296
But I’ll share the electricity bill.

51
00:03:36,441 --> 00:03:37,105
Don’t worry about it.

52
00:03:37,478 --> 00:03:38,708
I can support my boyfriend.

53
00:03:39,047 --> 00:03:39,749
No.

54
00:03:40,350 --> 00:03:42,500
My mom told me to help you too.

55
00:03:42,820 --> 00:03:44,051
I can’t live here for free without doing anything.

56
00:03:44,943 --> 00:03:46,602
You can just be cute.

57
00:03:47,903 --> 00:03:49,219
I'm not making you do nothing.

58
00:03:51,100 --> 00:03:52,100
Since we started dating,

59
00:03:52,288 --> 00:03:53,374
your mouth’s been getting sweeter.

60
00:03:53,414 --> 00:03:54,721
How do you know my mouth is sweet?

61
00:03:54,807 --> 00:03:55,382
Come and taste it.

62
00:03:55,398 --> 00:03:56,767
No tasting.

63
00:03:57,709 --> 00:03:59,757
No tasting, huh?

64
00:04:00,072 --> 00:04:02,503
I’m not falling for your trick, old uncle.

65
00:04:04,680 --> 00:04:05,506
How mean.

66
00:04:06,360 --> 00:04:07,103
By the way,

67
00:04:07,835 --> 00:04:10,299
are you going to the peer mentoring group draw?

68
00:04:10,645 --> 00:04:11,174
Of course.

69
00:04:12,722 --> 00:04:13,355
Oh, that’s unusual.

70
00:04:14,434 --> 00:04:17,743
Jet and Pun said you normally
don’t go to those chaotic events.

71
00:04:18,361 --> 00:04:19,854
I haven’t been going

72
00:04:20,120 --> 00:04:21,114
because I didn’t have a boyfriend.

73
00:04:21,506 --> 00:04:23,940
Now that I do and he’s really cute,

74
00:04:25,500 --> 00:04:26,948
how can I let him out of my sight?

75
00:04:34,948 --> 00:04:38,628
I’m only cute in your eyes.

76
00:04:39,230 --> 00:04:40,794
No one else is going to pay any attention to me.

77
00:04:43,100 --> 00:04:45,023
Don’t forget to bring the camera.

78
00:04:45,278 --> 00:04:46,783
I already put the memory card in
and charged it for you.

79
00:04:47,854 --> 00:04:48,417
Camera?

80
00:04:49,595 --> 00:04:50,134
Yeah.

81
00:04:51,905 --> 00:04:53,980
Aren’t you the admin of Engineer Cute Boy?

82
00:04:56,718 --> 00:04:57,832
You’ll have to take photos
and post them on your page.

83
00:05:02,241 --> 00:05:03,869
You know I’m the admin?

84
00:05:04,069 --> 00:05:04,551
Yeah.

85
00:05:05,951 --> 00:05:07,407
When were you planning to tell me?

86
00:05:07,715 --> 00:05:08,197
Huh?

87
00:05:11,262 --> 00:05:12,585
I wasn’t even going to tell you.

88
00:05:13,480 --> 00:05:14,508
I’m no longer doing that.

89
00:05:15,220 --> 00:05:16,293
I already quit.

90
00:05:16,440 --> 00:05:18,260
I logged out of all my social media accounts.

91
00:05:18,967 --> 00:05:19,937
No more.

92
00:05:20,408 --> 00:05:21,222
You’re so subtle.

93
00:05:22,225 --> 00:05:22,905
Are you mad?

94
00:05:25,654 --> 00:05:26,976
Actually, I’ll admit

95
00:05:27,610 --> 00:05:29,865
I was shy when you messaged me,

96
00:05:30,881 --> 00:05:33,368
saying I was cute or telling me
to delete the photos.

97
00:05:33,918 --> 00:05:34,897
I saw everything.

98
00:05:36,462 --> 00:05:37,619
Don’t you think I’m shy

99
00:05:38,007 --> 00:05:39,419
that you’ve read all those messages?

100
00:05:41,160 --> 00:05:42,111
There’s nothing to be shy about.

101
00:05:42,190 --> 00:05:42,773
It was cute.

102
00:05:49,426 --> 00:05:51,478
You think by doing this,

103
00:05:52,207 --> 00:05:53,214
I’ll stop being mad at you?

104
00:05:55,122 --> 00:05:56,565
Alright, let me kiss the other side too.

105
00:06:00,610 --> 00:06:01,259
Fine, we’re good.

106
00:06:03,365 --> 00:06:03,973
That easily?

107
00:06:04,254 --> 00:06:05,328
I thought it’d be harder.

108
00:06:06,811 --> 00:06:07,665
You want it hard?

109
00:06:08,297 --> 00:06:08,863
Sure.

110
00:06:11,814 --> 00:06:12,374
Arc!

111
00:06:12,720 --> 00:06:13,180
Hey!

112
00:06:21,847 --> 00:06:22,682
Wow.

113
00:06:23,870 --> 00:06:24,669
We can live here.

114
00:06:25,109 --> 00:06:26,168
It’s not as bad as I thought.

115
00:06:28,488 --> 00:06:29,651
It’s much better these days.

116
00:06:36,760 --> 00:06:41,930
WITSAWA GUN-YOTHA

117
00:06:44,943 --> 00:06:46,028
Wow.

118
00:06:47,188 --> 00:06:48,466
It’s so minimal here.

119
00:06:49,770 --> 00:06:51,069
You can choose which bed you want to sleep on.

120
00:06:52,921 --> 00:06:53,549
You go ahead.

121
00:06:54,017 --> 00:06:55,269
No, you go ahead.

122
00:06:55,275 --> 00:06:56,127
I can take either bed.

123
00:06:58,050 --> 00:06:58,872
Then I’ll take this one.

124
00:06:59,420 --> 00:06:59,968
No.

125
00:07:00,275 --> 00:07:01,251
I think that one’s better.

126
00:07:01,431 --> 00:07:02,995
You get the light coming in and a good view.

127
00:07:03,324 --> 00:07:04,090
I’ll take this one.

128
00:07:04,527 --> 00:07:05,896
Choose something nice for yourself for once.

129
00:07:06,170 --> 00:07:08,100
Stop sacrificing for others all the time,

130
00:07:08,924 --> 00:07:10,050
especially for me.

131
00:07:15,890 --> 00:07:16,404
By the way,

132
00:07:17,397 --> 00:07:20,176
living together like this
reminds me of when we were young.

133
00:07:20,768 --> 00:07:22,002
Before I moved to live with Mom.

134
00:07:24,834 --> 00:07:26,306
It was fun back then.

135
00:07:27,028 --> 00:07:27,715
It wasn’t lonely.

136
00:07:32,285 --> 00:07:33,428
But when I moved back,

137
00:07:33,937 --> 00:07:35,309
you took over the room for yourself.

138
00:07:35,734 --> 00:07:36,397
You brat.

139
00:07:41,217 --> 00:07:42,185
I never asked

140
00:07:44,370 --> 00:07:47,573
if it hurt that Mom sent you back to live with us.

141
00:07:55,789 --> 00:07:58,428
Like I told you, living with Mom was lonely.

142
00:07:59,140 --> 00:08:00,663
Moving back to live with you,

143
00:08:00,685 --> 00:08:03,109
Dad, and Newton was much more fun.

144
00:08:03,574 --> 00:08:04,208
It’s not lonely either.

145
00:08:12,810 --> 00:08:13,868
I’m staying over at the bar tonight.

146
00:08:14,040 --> 00:08:14,693
Wanna join me?

147
00:08:14,848 --> 00:08:15,660
I’ll sleep here

148
00:08:15,961 --> 00:08:18,300
and see if there are any ghosts.

149
00:08:18,509 --> 00:08:20,121
If there are, I’ll beat the crap out of them.

150
00:08:20,170 --> 00:08:20,834
You idiot.

151
00:08:21,687 --> 00:08:22,640
How are you going to sleep here?

152
00:08:22,685 --> 00:08:23,986
We don’t even have a bedsheet yet.

153
00:08:24,637 --> 00:08:26,681
I’ll just survey the place a couple of times

154
00:08:26,696 --> 00:08:27,774
then go shopping.

155
00:08:28,496 --> 00:08:29,311
Then take the car.

156
00:08:29,777 --> 00:08:30,531
I’ll grab a taxi.

157
00:08:31,069 --> 00:08:31,565
Hey.

158
00:08:32,254 --> 00:08:32,825
I’m going.

159
00:08:34,445 --> 00:08:36,065
I’ll get you a pink bedsheet.

160
00:08:39,520 --> 00:08:40,550
Screw you.

161
00:08:41,302 --> 00:08:42,226
What did you say?

162
00:08:42,617 --> 00:08:43,619
Did you want a Hello Kitty one?

163
00:08:44,955 --> 00:08:46,217
Or maybe My Melody?

164
00:08:46,557 --> 00:08:47,205
Garfield?

165
00:08:51,640 --> 00:08:52,240
Hello.

166
00:08:52,675 --> 00:08:53,988
My name is Warat Oon-arun.

167
00:08:54,361 --> 00:08:56,002
I’m in grade 12.

168
00:08:56,734 --> 00:08:59,383
If I get accepted into this university,

169
00:08:59,651 --> 00:09:00,648
I’ll...

170
00:09:01,480 --> 00:09:02,828
change my name to

171
00:09:03,717 --> 00:09:04,551
I’m already at the Engineering faculty.

172
00:09:04,854 --> 00:09:05,678
Witsawa.

173
00:09:06,388 --> 00:09:06,905
What?

174
00:09:13,248 --> 00:09:15,654
Witsawa it is.

175
00:09:37,583 --> 00:09:39,250
Are you bringing your blankie too?

176
00:09:40,457 --> 00:09:40,979
Hmm?

177
00:09:41,693 --> 00:09:42,354
Can’t I?

178
00:09:43,386 --> 00:09:44,357
I’m afraid I won’t be able to sleep without it.

179
00:09:44,620 --> 00:09:45,728
Your friends will think it’s embarrassing.

180
00:09:46,091 --> 00:09:48,509
Why don’t you leave it here
and come back for it when you visit?

181
00:09:48,979 --> 00:09:49,462
Hmm?

182
00:09:50,392 --> 00:09:51,200
Fine.

183
00:09:51,438 --> 00:09:52,385
I can’t believe

184
00:09:52,785 --> 00:09:54,758
you got accepted to a famous Engineering school.

185
00:09:54,808 --> 00:09:55,234
Why not?

186
00:09:55,254 --> 00:09:57,306
Even you were an exchange student abroad, sis.

187
00:09:57,957 --> 00:09:58,749
Come on.

188
00:09:59,373 --> 00:10:02,066
Both my kids are talented.

189
00:10:05,460 --> 00:10:06,269
By the way, Gun,

190
00:10:07,528 --> 00:10:09,157
are you bringing your baby too?

191
00:10:09,672 --> 00:10:12,902
Yes, so it can take me back to visit you often.

192
00:10:14,149 --> 00:10:14,971
Let me hug you.

193
00:10:17,844 --> 00:10:18,542
Now kisses too.

194
00:10:21,146 --> 00:10:21,779
Come on.

195
00:10:22,192 --> 00:10:23,382
You’re a grown-ass man.

196
00:10:23,837 --> 00:10:24,989
Stop acting like a child.

197
00:10:26,210 --> 00:10:26,702
Why?

198
00:10:27,029 --> 00:10:28,185
You could’ve just said
you wanted me to hug you too.

199
00:10:28,225 --> 00:10:28,702
No.

200
00:10:28,816 --> 00:10:29,730
Don’t do it.

201
00:10:31,183 --> 00:10:31,623
Hey!

202
00:10:33,037 --> 00:10:33,811
Don’t come any closer!

203
00:10:35,189 --> 00:10:36,154
- Let’s hug.
- No.

204
00:10:37,308 --> 00:10:37,857
Enough.

205
00:10:37,985 --> 00:10:39,758
I know you love me, okay?

206
00:10:40,355 --> 00:10:40,899
I surrender.

207
00:10:44,890 --> 00:10:45,434
Here you go.

208
00:10:59,496 --> 00:10:59,989
Ouch!

209
00:11:14,774 --> 00:11:15,782
Can I get

210
00:11:17,158 --> 00:11:17,997
an Americano?

211
00:11:18,663 --> 00:11:19,343
Do you have the card?

212
00:11:19,739 --> 00:11:20,311
No.

213
00:11:20,540 --> 00:11:21,819
Can I just get the sticker?

214
00:11:22,700 --> 00:11:23,197
Thank you.

215
00:11:34,367 --> 00:11:35,308
What were you laughing at?

216
00:11:36,377 --> 00:11:37,094
I’m sorry.

217
00:11:37,574 --> 00:11:38,317
I didn’t mean it.

218
00:11:44,037 --> 00:11:46,579
All done.

219
00:11:48,712 --> 00:11:49,980
I was just kidding.

220
00:11:51,297 --> 00:11:52,405
Do you come here often?

221
00:11:54,269 --> 00:11:54,825
No.

222
00:11:55,912 --> 00:11:57,351
I normally go to another branch.

223
00:11:57,429 --> 00:11:58,127
I see.

224
00:11:59,997 --> 00:12:01,402
I never finish these things.

225
00:12:02,099 --> 00:12:05,379
Seeing a complete card like this
makes me feel like a winner.

226
00:12:06,210 --> 00:12:08,020
Do we…

227
00:12:09,965 --> 00:12:10,814
No, we don’t know each other.

228
00:12:11,659 --> 00:12:12,885
But you’re a freshman too, right?

229
00:12:13,804 --> 00:12:14,711
We’ll get to know each other soon enough.

230
00:12:14,760 --> 00:12:15,325
No.

231
00:12:16,469 --> 00:12:17,275
I’m in grade 12.

232
00:12:17,791 --> 00:12:20,814
Oh, then what are you doing here?

233
00:12:21,050 --> 00:12:22,229
I just came to visit.

234
00:12:22,949 --> 00:12:23,728
I want to study here.

235
00:12:24,918 --> 00:12:25,524
Really?

236
00:12:26,543 --> 00:12:29,780
See you next year, then, Junior.

237
00:12:32,973 --> 00:12:33,714
My ride is here.

238
00:12:34,048 --> 00:12:34,737
I should go.

239
00:12:37,748 --> 00:12:38,213
Hey.

240
00:12:44,960 --> 00:12:47,410
WINE

241
00:12:49,720 --> 00:12:50,315
Wine?

242
00:12:53,354 --> 00:12:54,002
Is he a foreigner?

243
00:13:13,670 --> 00:13:15,140
Mom came home

244
00:13:15,610 --> 00:13:16,752
and you guys are on the run.

245
00:13:17,734 --> 00:13:18,982
As if you’re home.

246
00:13:19,887 --> 00:13:20,871
Watch your attitude.

247
00:13:21,145 --> 00:13:22,105
I’m your big bro.

248
00:13:23,632 --> 00:13:24,120
Wait.

249
00:13:25,725 --> 00:13:27,251
Wa had your room cleaned.

250
00:13:27,922 --> 00:13:29,828
I told him Mom was coming home today,

251
00:13:30,411 --> 00:13:31,481
so he went ahead and did that.

252
00:13:31,505 --> 00:13:32,125
Next time, don’t bother.

253
00:13:48,770 --> 00:13:49,367
Yotha!

254
00:13:58,074 --> 00:13:58,663
It’s fine.

255
00:13:59,361 --> 00:14:00,400
Don’t mind him.

256
00:14:00,930 --> 00:14:02,457
You always let him get away with it.

257
00:14:03,823 --> 00:14:06,770
You know why Yotha is like this.

258
00:14:20,465 --> 00:14:21,417
Hi, Mom.

259
00:14:21,722 --> 00:14:22,597
Hi, Kloy.

260
00:14:22,920 --> 00:14:25,764
I’m Gun’s adorable roommate.

261
00:14:27,946 --> 00:14:28,469
Please come in.

262
00:14:34,112 --> 00:14:37,911
I’m glad you’re living with your best friend.

263
00:14:39,336 --> 00:14:40,477
At least there’s AC here.

264
00:14:42,434 --> 00:14:43,798
Where’s your family, Kong?

265
00:14:44,040 --> 00:14:45,164
They hurriedly came and left.

266
00:14:45,430 --> 00:14:47,614
I’m always alone.

267
00:14:47,708 --> 00:14:48,565
I was waiting for you.

268
00:14:49,160 --> 00:14:50,004
Poor boy.

269
00:14:50,783 --> 00:14:51,810
There, there.

270
00:14:54,068 --> 00:14:56,287
Do you remember what Dad and I told you?

271
00:14:57,785 --> 00:14:58,453
Yes.

272
00:14:58,783 --> 00:14:59,518
What do you remember?

273
00:14:59,939 --> 00:15:02,171
It’s okay to love but don’t let it affect my studies.

274
00:15:02,426 --> 00:15:03,198
I can’t prank my friends.

275
00:15:03,734 --> 00:15:05,201
But I never prank anyone first, Mom.

276
00:15:05,832 --> 00:15:07,551
Dad said not to start it,

277
00:15:08,121 --> 00:15:09,042
but if they started it,

278
00:15:09,337 --> 00:15:10,099
I must not lose.

279
00:15:10,706 --> 00:15:11,297
Hey.

280
00:15:12,057 --> 00:15:13,491
Just kidding.

281
00:15:14,268 --> 00:15:16,001
I should use reason to fix problems,

282
00:15:16,302 --> 00:15:17,127
not violence.

283
00:15:18,571 --> 00:15:19,508
I memorized it by heart.

284
00:15:20,247 --> 00:15:21,014
What else?

285
00:15:21,611 --> 00:15:22,180
Uh…

286
00:15:23,031 --> 00:15:25,306
I must separate colored clothes from whites
before sending them to the laundry

287
00:15:25,739 --> 00:15:27,411
and I must wash my underwear myself.

288
00:15:27,610 --> 00:15:28,777
My son is the best.

289
00:15:28,998 --> 00:15:29,699
Let’s hug.

290
00:15:30,840 --> 00:15:32,154
I love you, Mom.

291
00:15:32,364 --> 00:15:33,054
I know.

292
00:15:37,048 --> 00:15:37,773
Stop it.

293
00:15:38,235 --> 00:15:40,235
- You’re giving me goosebumps.
- I love you too, Kloy.

294
00:15:40,260 --> 00:15:41,186
I know you love me.

295
00:15:41,214 --> 00:15:41,749
You don’t have to do this.

296
00:15:41,765 --> 00:15:43,749
Mom, I love you too.

297
00:15:44,066 --> 00:15:44,721
What are you doing?

298
00:15:44,829 --> 00:15:46,038
She’s my mom.

299
00:15:46,511 --> 00:15:47,411
You’re my friend.

300
00:15:47,614 --> 00:15:48,968
My friend’s mom is like my own.

301
00:15:49,044 --> 00:15:49,377
Mom.

302
00:15:49,395 --> 00:15:49,878
Hey.

303
00:15:50,376 --> 00:15:51,878
Stop it.

304
00:15:51,903 --> 00:15:52,800
Stop it.

305
00:15:53,145 --> 00:15:53,706
Hey.

306
00:15:54,440 --> 00:15:55,745
Don’t do that to your friend.

307
00:15:58,211 --> 00:16:01,398
Welcome back to our heaven, Mr. Yotha.

308
00:16:02,758 --> 00:16:03,629
Did you buy all of this yourself?

309
00:16:03,765 --> 00:16:05,020
Yes, of course.

310
00:16:05,515 --> 00:16:07,882
I can’t have my beloved big bro
be uncomfortable, can I?

311
00:16:08,170 --> 00:16:09,567
Is it you or me who fears being uncomfortable?

312
00:16:09,847 --> 00:16:11,120
Sit down.

313
00:16:11,525 --> 00:16:12,976
Come on. I’m hungry.

314
00:16:13,204 --> 00:16:13,909
Let’s go find something to eat.

315
00:16:14,152 --> 00:16:15,140
Won’t it be easier to just order food delivery?

316
00:16:16,321 --> 00:16:16,822
Sure.

317
00:16:16,930 --> 00:16:17,628
What do you want to eat?

318
00:16:18,360 --> 00:16:18,937
Up to you.

319
00:16:19,543 --> 00:16:21,217
Japanese food, then.

320
00:16:21,407 --> 00:16:21,920
Is that okay?

321
00:16:23,057 --> 00:16:23,521
Yeah.

322
00:16:23,589 --> 00:16:25,562
Okay, I’ll place the order now,

323
00:16:25,582 --> 00:16:26,314
but you’ll pay.

324
00:16:27,585 --> 00:16:28,238
You’ll pay.

325
00:16:29,611 --> 00:16:30,518
I’m your little brother

326
00:16:30,998 --> 00:16:33,000
and you want me to pay?

327
00:16:33,077 --> 00:16:33,654
Let’s split the bill.

328
00:16:34,210 --> 00:16:36,174
Fine, we can do that.

329
00:16:46,668 --> 00:16:49,097
Freedom smells sweet.

330
00:16:49,829 --> 00:16:52,677
I really want to take a photo of your face
right now and send it to your mom.

331
00:16:53,644 --> 00:16:55,884
I’m still her good son.

332
00:16:55,971 --> 00:16:56,361
Sure.

333
00:16:56,377 --> 00:16:57,524
Don’t even think about telling on me.

334
00:16:58,414 --> 00:16:58,911
Hey,

335
00:16:59,768 --> 00:17:01,592
I’ve been meaning to ask you something.

336
00:17:02,085 --> 00:17:02,600
What is it?

337
00:17:03,188 --> 00:17:06,506
Well, why do you sleep with the lights on?

338
00:17:07,069 --> 00:17:08,262
Haven’t you ever slept with the lights on?

339
00:17:09,014 --> 00:17:09,700
I have,

340
00:17:10,281 --> 00:17:12,398
but only when I’m somewhere unfamiliar.

341
00:17:14,151 --> 00:17:15,124
Do you leave the lights on every night?

342
00:17:16,084 --> 00:17:16,616
Yeah,

343
00:17:17,303 --> 00:17:19,161
but if you can’t sleep, you can tell me.

344
00:17:19,617 --> 00:17:20,362
Don’t hold back.

345
00:17:20,638 --> 00:17:21,613
No.

346
00:17:22,026 --> 00:17:22,936
I’ll be fine.

347
00:17:22,961 --> 00:17:23,945
No problem.

348
00:17:24,650 --> 00:17:26,490
I just want to know...

349
00:17:27,960 --> 00:17:29,272
if you’ve been sleeping with
the lights on since you were born.

350
00:17:30,306 --> 00:17:30,828
No.

351
00:17:31,300 --> 00:17:32,823
I think it started when I was about 5 or 6 years old.

352
00:17:33,361 --> 00:17:35,456
I was stuck in the storage room for like an hour,

353
00:17:35,970 --> 00:17:36,921
and then I became traumatized.

354
00:17:37,328 --> 00:17:37,859
Oh.

355
00:17:37,878 --> 00:17:39,374
Since then, my mind's been wondering.

356
00:17:39,454 --> 00:17:40,208
You mean wandering.

357
00:17:40,296 --> 00:17:40,903
Heh.

358
00:17:42,472 --> 00:17:45,468
Yeah, I started thinking that in the dark,

359
00:17:45,539 --> 00:17:47,903
there are ghosts or something scary.

360
00:17:48,174 --> 00:17:48,897
Ah.

361
00:17:49,229 --> 00:17:50,202
I just don’t like

362
00:17:50,386 --> 00:17:52,269
not being able to see what’s around me.

363
00:17:52,453 --> 00:17:52,973
That’s all.

364
00:17:53,041 --> 00:17:54,336
We’ve studied together since secondary school.

365
00:17:54,611 --> 00:17:56,149
Why did you never tell me about this?

366
00:17:56,309 --> 00:17:58,096
It’s not important

367
00:17:58,586 --> 00:18:00,731
and I didn’t think I’d become your roommate.

368
00:18:01,468 --> 00:18:02,265
That’s true.

369
00:18:02,909 --> 00:18:05,164
But what if the power goes out?

370
00:18:05,423 --> 00:18:06,306
Will you need any medicine?

371
00:18:06,398 --> 00:18:07,281
Where’s your medicine?

372
00:18:07,299 --> 00:18:07,874
Tell me.

373
00:18:07,891 --> 00:18:08,933
It’s not that bad.

374
00:18:09,656 --> 00:18:10,974
It’s just that if I sleep in the dark,

375
00:18:11,531 --> 00:18:12,900
I’ll have a nightmare.

376
00:18:13,308 --> 00:18:15,900
I won’t have trouble breathing
or go into shock like you think.

377
00:18:16,451 --> 00:18:18,106
Alright, that’s a relief.

378
00:18:20,749 --> 00:18:21,269
I’m hungry.

379
00:18:21,545 --> 00:18:22,202
Have you eaten?

380
00:18:22,631 --> 00:18:23,121
Not yet.

381
00:18:23,710 --> 00:18:24,697
Shall we go get something to eat downstairs?

382
00:18:25,069 --> 00:18:25,663
Let’s go, buddy.

383
00:18:25,680 --> 00:18:26,158
Yes.

384
00:18:26,705 --> 00:18:27,216
Let’s go.

385
00:18:27,767 --> 00:18:28,780
I’m hungry.

386
00:18:31,339 --> 00:18:32,108
What should we eat?

387
00:18:36,240 --> 00:18:36,980
Is that Japanese food?

388
00:18:38,699 --> 00:18:39,211
Yes.

389
00:18:39,583 --> 00:18:40,617
Japanese food looks good.

390
00:18:45,685 --> 00:18:46,477
Let’s eat.

391
00:18:46,802 --> 00:18:47,718
Let’s get some Japanese food.

392
00:18:48,684 --> 00:18:49,311
Japanese food.

393
00:18:49,350 --> 00:18:50,259
Let’s go!

394
00:18:53,091 --> 00:18:54,299
All the food looks so good.

395
00:18:56,398 --> 00:18:56,897
Shall we?

396
00:18:57,263 --> 00:18:57,746
Let’s go.

397
00:19:05,346 --> 00:19:06,060
So good.

398
00:19:06,152 --> 00:19:07,097
This one is good too.

399
00:19:07,791 --> 00:19:08,776
Oh, oh.

400
00:19:11,902 --> 00:19:12,761
Everything is delicious.

401
00:19:14,635 --> 00:19:17,173
I think we’ll spend all our money in one week.

402
00:19:19,065 --> 00:19:19,628
It’s okay.

403
00:19:21,620 --> 00:19:22,524
We can ask for more.

404
00:19:22,841 --> 00:19:23,463
Yay!

405
00:19:23,838 --> 00:19:24,374
Let’s keep eating.

406
00:19:25,660 --> 00:19:26,877
Where do you think I should put this, Po?

407
00:19:27,002 --> 00:19:28,032
Why don’t you put it on your head?

408
00:19:28,383 --> 00:19:29,576
Here I come.

409
00:19:29,645 --> 00:19:30,373
Do you need help with anything?

410
00:19:30,552 --> 00:19:32,450
What took you so long?

411
00:19:33,340 --> 00:19:34,838
We’re almost done.

412
00:19:35,200 --> 00:19:36,580
Then I’m leaving.

413
00:19:37,550 --> 00:19:38,183
Just kidding.

414
00:19:42,573 --> 00:19:43,514
What’s wrong, Pun?

415
00:19:43,820 --> 00:19:45,413
It’s because of you, Arm.

416
00:19:45,730 --> 00:19:46,250
Me?

417
00:19:46,540 --> 00:19:47,056
Yeah.

418
00:19:47,899 --> 00:19:48,608
What did I do?

419
00:19:48,626 --> 00:19:50,807
Did I step on your feet?

420
00:19:51,053 --> 00:19:51,797
No.

421
00:19:53,112 --> 00:19:54,527
You’re here with your boyfriend.

422
00:19:54,871 --> 00:19:56,016
It makes me miss Jet.

423
00:19:56,671 --> 00:19:57,238
Come on.

424
00:19:57,644 --> 00:19:59,103
Jet went to work, not to war.

425
00:19:59,720 --> 00:20:00,737
He’s coming to pick you up, right?

426
00:20:01,117 --> 00:20:03,177
That’s still several hours away, Arc.

427
00:20:03,893 --> 00:20:05,288
It’s alright, Pun.

428
00:20:05,859 --> 00:20:06,674
Look, Arm.

429
00:20:07,410 --> 00:20:09,373
Once Arc graduates and starts working,

430
00:20:10,161 --> 00:20:11,275
you’ll know how I feel.

431
00:20:19,773 --> 00:20:21,004
We ate too much.

432
00:20:21,125 --> 00:20:21,971
What should we eat next time?

433
00:20:22,497 --> 00:20:23,974
You’re already thinking about
what to eat? I’m still full.

434
00:20:24,084 --> 00:20:25,097
Crispy pork with basil would be nice though.

435
00:20:26,684 --> 00:20:27,174
Let’s go in.

436
00:20:32,198 --> 00:20:32,754
I can’t unlock it.

437
00:20:33,022 --> 00:20:33,607
Let me try.

438
00:20:35,708 --> 00:20:36,706
Why can’t we unlock it?

439
00:20:39,250 --> 00:20:39,777
Yes?

440
00:20:40,859 --> 00:20:41,807
Can I help you?

441
00:20:42,312 --> 00:20:43,065
Who is it?

442
00:20:43,910 --> 00:20:44,666
Which room is this?

443
00:20:44,764 --> 00:20:45,536
411.

444
00:20:47,054 --> 00:20:47,854
Oh, shit.

445
00:20:47,940 --> 00:20:49,445
It’s the wrong floor.

446
00:20:49,468 --> 00:20:50,361
We’re sorry.

447
00:20:50,542 --> 00:20:51,570
It’s fine.

448
00:20:53,200 --> 00:20:54,198
It’s...

449
00:20:56,437 --> 00:20:57,026
It’s fine.

450
00:21:00,951 --> 00:21:02,645
I thought they were running in.

451
00:21:03,192 --> 00:21:04,600
Luckily, I learned Taekwondo.

452
00:21:10,200 --> 00:21:11,090
PUT THE WIDER SIDE ON TOP
OF THE NARROWER SIDE.

453
00:21:13,182 --> 00:21:14,305
This is so damn hard.

454
00:21:14,742 --> 00:21:15,798
Why do we have to tie it?

455
00:21:17,765 --> 00:21:18,602
We don’t.

456
00:21:19,217 --> 00:21:19,899
We do.

457
00:21:20,866 --> 00:21:22,420
Freshmen need to wear the uniform properly.

458
00:21:24,838 --> 00:21:25,487
Nonsense.

459
00:21:25,835 --> 00:21:26,317
Yes!

460
00:21:28,197 --> 00:21:28,721
Come here.

461
00:21:29,282 --> 00:21:29,829
Get up.

462
00:21:30,143 --> 00:21:30,684
No.

463
00:21:30,690 --> 00:21:31,791
Let me tie it for you. Come on.

464
00:21:36,100 --> 00:21:36,617
Here.

465
00:21:38,080 --> 00:21:39,471
Here, look.

466
00:21:39,647 --> 00:21:41,121
So you can do it yourself next time, okay?

467
00:21:42,757 --> 00:21:43,954
You’re not looking, you jerk.

468
00:21:44,130 --> 00:21:45,573
I won’t be able to do it anyway.

469
00:21:45,800 --> 00:21:46,574
Why should I look?

470
00:21:48,482 --> 00:21:49,002
Fine.

471
00:21:49,648 --> 00:21:50,724
I’ve already ordered the pre-tied ones.

472
00:21:51,000 --> 00:21:51,810
They’ll arrive in a few days.

473
00:21:51,992 --> 00:21:52,568
Smart.

474
00:21:55,671 --> 00:21:56,142
Hey.

475
00:21:57,154 --> 00:21:58,025
Can I borrow your perfume?

476
00:21:58,743 --> 00:21:59,226
Yeah.

477
00:22:02,400 --> 00:22:05,290
ALARM

478
00:22:51,779 --> 00:22:52,868
Hey, you cheeky kid.

479
00:22:53,091 --> 00:22:53,564
Oh.

480
00:22:55,456 --> 00:22:56,423
You’re still here.

481
00:22:57,610 --> 00:22:59,355
Do you trick me into kissing you every morning?

482
00:23:26,777 --> 00:23:27,309
Hey.

483
00:23:27,835 --> 00:23:28,327
Hmm?

484
00:23:29,005 --> 00:23:29,722
Do I look handsome yet?

485
00:23:31,496 --> 00:23:32,000
Yeah.

486
00:23:32,654 --> 00:23:33,376
Your outfit looks good

487
00:23:34,204 --> 00:23:35,386
but your face looks like shit.

488
00:23:36,065 --> 00:23:36,943
Come on.

489
00:23:37,152 --> 00:23:37,974
I’ll tell Kloy about this.

490
00:23:39,235 --> 00:23:39,801
Calm down.

491
00:23:41,308 --> 00:23:42,324
Let’s talk nicely.

492
00:23:43,568 --> 00:23:45,071
We’re good friends.

493
00:23:45,413 --> 00:23:46,232
Please.

494
00:23:46,505 --> 00:23:47,579
You never shave your mustache, do you?

495
00:23:49,524 --> 00:23:50,573
What do we have to do today?

496
00:23:50,604 --> 00:23:52,177
I saw so many activities in the group chat.

497
00:23:53,552 --> 00:23:54,657
Drawing lots to get in our peer mentoring group.

498
00:23:55,032 --> 00:23:57,042
Getting our ID photos taken.

499
00:23:58,017 --> 00:23:58,640
That’s all I remember.

500
00:23:59,983 --> 00:24:02,614
I think we need to make friends.

501
00:24:02,854 --> 00:24:04,198
The two of us can’t make it on our own.

502
00:24:05,081 --> 00:24:05,562
Agreed.

503
00:24:06,391 --> 00:24:07,597
- Come on. We don’t want to be late.
- Let’s go.

504
00:24:08,922 --> 00:24:09,423
Wait.

505
00:24:11,238 --> 00:24:12,604
We’re getting our ID photos taken today, right?

506
00:24:12,640 --> 00:24:13,102
Yeah.

507
00:24:13,520 --> 00:24:15,117
Give me a moment to style my hair.

508
00:24:18,251 --> 00:24:19,114
Come on. Let me style yours.

509
00:24:19,287 --> 00:24:19,943
No.

510
00:24:20,013 --> 00:24:20,491
Don’t.

511
00:24:20,512 --> 00:24:21,706
- Do you want my help?
- No.

512
00:24:23,035 --> 00:24:24,152
Come on. Let me help you.

513
00:24:24,170 --> 00:24:25,125
Hey. Let me.

514
00:24:30,197 --> 00:24:30,909
Do I look okay?

515
00:24:31,432 --> 00:24:32,253
Yes, what about me?

516
00:24:33,930 --> 00:24:34,607
Just need to fix this here.

517
00:24:36,269 --> 00:24:37,271
Come on. Let me style your hair in return.

518
00:24:37,290 --> 00:24:38,442
No need.

519
00:24:42,770 --> 00:24:43,521
Damn.

520
00:24:45,847 --> 00:24:46,888
Where do we start?

521
00:24:47,877 --> 00:24:48,594
No idea.

522
00:24:52,814 --> 00:24:53,431
Over there?

523
00:24:54,610 --> 00:24:55,202
I guess.

524
00:24:55,805 --> 00:24:56,597
Hey.

525
00:24:57,102 --> 00:24:58,807
Please grab the application

526
00:24:59,060 --> 00:25:00,142
and get in the queue for the photos.

527
00:25:00,634 --> 00:25:01,973
Oh.

528
00:25:07,281 --> 00:25:08,125
My name is Faifa.

529
00:25:08,442 --> 00:25:09,161
I’m in Electrical Engineering.

530
00:25:09,548 --> 00:25:10,522
Oh.

531
00:25:10,857 --> 00:25:11,474
I’m Gun.

532
00:25:11,720 --> 00:25:12,379
He’s Kong.

533
00:25:12,600 --> 00:25:13,383
We’re in Chemical Engineering.

534
00:25:14,660 --> 00:25:15,274
Oh.

535
00:25:16,014 --> 00:25:17,084
I thought you were in Electrical Engineering.

536
00:25:17,114 --> 00:25:17,801
Sorry, my bad.

537
00:25:17,816 --> 00:25:18,444
Wait.

538
00:25:19,774 --> 00:25:21,336
Freshmen study together.

539
00:25:21,478 --> 00:25:23,537
We can stay together.

540
00:25:24,336 --> 00:25:24,875
You’re right.

541
00:25:25,466 --> 00:25:28,069
Let’s fill in our applications, new friends.

542
00:25:28,182 --> 00:25:28,607
Let’s go.

543
00:25:34,936 --> 00:25:36,120
Why are there so many things?

544
00:25:36,577 --> 00:25:38,002
I filled out a lot when I applied to study here.

545
00:25:38,198 --> 00:25:38,677
Right?

546
00:25:39,100 --> 00:25:41,026
I gave them so much info about me,
they could turn it into a movie by now.

547
00:25:41,094 --> 00:25:41,629
Yeah.

548
00:25:44,044 --> 00:25:44,776
Oh, sorry.

549
00:25:46,062 --> 00:25:46,908
You’re lefthanded?

550
00:25:48,035 --> 00:25:48,505
Yes.

551
00:25:50,386 --> 00:25:52,598
Why are you in Chemical Engineering?

552
00:25:53,540 --> 00:25:54,419
Because I could get in with my scores.

553
00:25:56,050 --> 00:25:56,648
What about you?

554
00:25:57,499 --> 00:26:00,625
Don’t tell me you’re in the Electrical department
because your name Faifa means electricity.

555
00:26:00,791 --> 00:26:01,351
Yeah.

556
00:26:02,302 --> 00:26:02,979
Are you crazy?

557
00:26:03,482 --> 00:26:04,700
If we choose based on our names,

558
00:26:05,081 --> 00:26:06,471
Kong should be studying photography.

559
00:26:06,685 --> 00:26:07,197
Oh?

560
00:26:07,973 --> 00:26:08,568
That makes sense.

561
00:26:08,887 --> 00:26:09,688
What does this have to do with me?

562
00:26:09,715 --> 00:26:10,820
Why aren’t you in Communication Arts?

563
00:26:11,653 --> 00:26:12,054
I’m done.

564
00:26:12,072 --> 00:26:12,946
That’s a totally different field.

565
00:26:12,973 --> 00:26:13,868
I’ll go get my photo taken.

566
00:26:14,160 --> 00:26:14,912
Wait for me when you’re done.

567
00:26:15,340 --> 00:26:15,902
Okay.

568
00:26:15,961 --> 00:26:16,565
I’ll be right back.

569
00:26:17,678 --> 00:26:18,574
We won’t wait for him.

570
00:26:20,974 --> 00:26:21,410
Hey.

571
00:26:21,428 --> 00:26:21,970
What?

572
00:26:22,165 --> 00:26:23,014
Look at our new friend.

573
00:26:24,020 --> 00:26:24,620
Look at him.

574
00:26:25,152 --> 00:26:25,724
Why?

575
00:26:26,943 --> 00:26:28,125
He’s wearing designer shoes.

576
00:26:29,122 --> 00:26:30,219
Not to mention his watch.

577
00:26:31,029 --> 00:26:31,837
Damn.

578
00:26:32,948 --> 00:26:33,850
He’s rich.

579
00:26:33,920 --> 00:26:34,521
Yeah.

580
00:26:38,743 --> 00:26:40,967
We found someone to pay for our meals.

581
00:26:41,930 --> 00:26:42,924
Next, please.

582
00:26:43,746 --> 00:26:44,346
Here you are.

583
00:26:51,099 --> 00:26:51,820
Done.

584
00:26:52,405 --> 00:26:52,968
What?

585
00:26:53,934 --> 00:26:54,808
Already?

586
00:26:54,835 --> 00:26:55,927
Yes, you may go.

587
00:26:56,256 --> 00:26:58,623
Aren’t we going to take extras just in case?

588
00:26:58,708 --> 00:26:59,564
No, you may go.

589
00:27:12,682 --> 00:27:13,469
I’ll wait outside.

590
00:27:13,656 --> 00:27:14,120
Okay.

591
00:27:22,880 --> 00:27:25,610
STUDENT ID: GUNYUKHOL JIRAROJ
CHEMICAL ENGINEERING

592
00:27:32,185 --> 00:27:34,097
What’s this face?

593
00:27:34,305 --> 00:27:34,955
Let me take care of it.

594
00:27:36,616 --> 00:27:37,114
See you.

595
00:27:37,745 --> 00:27:38,262
See you.

596
00:27:40,585 --> 00:27:42,441
Hey, what’s wrong?

597
00:27:43,242 --> 00:27:43,911
Bad photo?

598
00:27:45,277 --> 00:27:46,280
The camera is lying.

599
00:27:46,943 --> 00:27:48,481
As you can see, I’m so handsome in real life.

600
00:27:49,388 --> 00:27:51,245
Is the camera lying or are you lying to yourself?

601
00:27:51,266 --> 00:27:52,023
Fai, you jerk.

602
00:27:53,282 --> 00:27:54,816
They didn’t give me time to pose at all.

603
00:27:55,171 --> 00:27:56,761
Hey, look at this.

604
00:27:58,274 --> 00:27:59,856
Cameras are smart these days.

605
00:28:00,269 --> 00:28:01,574
Look at this photo.

606
00:28:03,770 --> 00:28:06,151
The camera can detect that
this is a photo of the sea.

607
00:28:06,583 --> 00:28:09,425
It can also detect when it’s a photo of food.

608
00:28:10,831 --> 00:28:11,365
Look.

609
00:28:12,099 --> 00:28:12,610
Hey.

610
00:28:13,234 --> 00:28:13,973
What are you doing?

611
00:28:14,013 --> 00:28:14,497
Look.

612
00:28:14,804 --> 00:28:16,091
When I take a photo of you,

613
00:28:16,604 --> 00:28:19,911
the camera detects and switches to pet mode.

614
00:28:21,324 --> 00:28:22,417
So all that introduction

615
00:28:22,711 --> 00:28:24,005
was just to say I look like a dog?

616
00:28:24,145 --> 00:28:24,977
I didn’t say that.

617
00:28:25,205 --> 00:28:26,514
Alright, enough.

618
00:28:26,720 --> 00:28:27,811
I’ll take you to eat dog food.

619
00:28:29,842 --> 00:28:30,887
The dog needs to pee.

620
00:28:31,250 --> 00:28:32,244
Let’s go.

621
00:28:32,588 --> 00:28:33,574
I’ll walk you on the leash.

622
00:28:33,921 --> 00:28:34,466
Hey!

623
00:28:40,505 --> 00:28:41,302
Where’s Gun?

624
00:28:42,054 --> 00:28:43,773
Now that he has a new friend, he’s abandoned me

625
00:28:47,194 --> 00:28:48,134
Arm, are you done?

626
00:28:49,228 --> 00:28:49,764
Is it good to go?

627
00:28:49,788 --> 00:28:50,765
Is this okay now?

628
00:28:50,782 --> 00:28:51,376
Let me see.

629
00:28:51,983 --> 00:28:52,974
Yes, that’s good to go.

630
00:28:54,632 --> 00:28:55,555
Let me rest a bit.

631
00:28:56,983 --> 00:28:57,945
You’re almost there.

632
00:29:01,350 --> 00:29:02,044
Hey, Pun.

633
00:29:02,300 --> 00:29:02,805
Hmm?

634
00:29:02,848 --> 00:29:07,509
Do you think
the Perfect 10 Liners' legend will continue?

635
00:29:08,940 --> 00:29:12,982
Actually, I gave up hope
when you joined our group, Arm.

636
00:29:13,062 --> 00:29:13,629
Hey.

637
00:29:15,170 --> 00:29:16,457
What do you mean by that?

638
00:29:16,642 --> 00:29:20,294
No, I mean you’re super handsome.

639
00:29:20,328 --> 00:29:21,120
You’re too handsome.

640
00:29:21,191 --> 00:29:22,204
And cute.

641
00:29:22,225 --> 00:29:23,653
I love it so much.

642
00:29:26,170 --> 00:29:26,831
That’s a relief.

643
00:29:26,970 --> 00:29:27,438
Hey,

644
00:29:27,924 --> 00:29:28,980
when will they finish drawing lots?

645
00:29:29,148 --> 00:29:29,955
I want to leave already.

646
00:29:30,269 --> 00:29:31,023
Are you sleepy?

647
00:29:31,860 --> 00:29:33,023
- Yeah.
- You can leave without me.

648
00:29:33,262 --> 00:29:34,699
No, I’ll stay.

649
00:29:36,111 --> 00:29:36,699
Arc,

650
00:29:37,137 --> 00:29:38,666
we’ll go to Bang On after that.

651
00:29:39,074 --> 00:29:40,823
Are you ditching us?

652
00:29:40,896 --> 00:29:41,826
Hey, Arc.

653
00:29:42,594 --> 00:29:43,589
You can’t ditch us.

654
00:29:44,040 --> 00:29:45,931
I want to welcome our junior.

655
00:29:46,028 --> 00:29:47,007
I won’t.

656
00:29:47,484 --> 00:29:50,354
I’ll always indulge you, Arm.

657
00:29:58,303 --> 00:30:01,063
Hey, am I still needed here?

658
00:30:08,779 --> 00:30:09,454
The water’s not running.

659
00:30:12,371 --> 00:30:13,970
Oh, shit!

660
00:30:14,958 --> 00:30:15,509
Ah!

661
00:30:16,451 --> 00:30:17,177
Help me!

662
00:30:18,028 --> 00:30:19,010
Ah! Help!

663
00:30:20,382 --> 00:30:21,303
Please help me!

664
00:30:21,960 --> 00:30:22,684
Ah!

665
00:30:24,253 --> 00:30:24,817
Help!

666
00:30:31,240 --> 00:30:32,120
Thank you.

667
00:30:39,377 --> 00:30:40,182
Was that Fai?

668
00:30:41,817 --> 00:30:42,711
Where’s he rushing off to?

669
00:30:48,090 --> 00:30:49,530
Damn it!

670
00:30:50,130 --> 00:30:51,262
My first day.

671
00:30:55,764 --> 00:30:56,854
I look like a wet puppy.

672
00:30:58,768 --> 00:30:59,776
Damn it.

673
00:31:00,362 --> 00:31:01,632
What the hell happened to you?

674
00:31:02,597 --> 00:31:04,327
The faucet in the restroom came off.

675
00:31:05,285 --> 00:31:07,309
Luckily, Faifa helped me.

676
00:31:08,622 --> 00:31:09,595
Where were you rushing off to, by the way?

677
00:31:11,137 --> 00:31:13,044
What do you mean I was rushing?

678
00:31:13,394 --> 00:31:15,106
You didn’t wait for me.

679
00:31:15,386 --> 00:31:16,162
What are you talking about?

680
00:31:16,481 --> 00:31:17,401
I’m here with you.

681
00:31:17,908 --> 00:31:19,616
No, I mean in the restroom.

682
00:31:20,060 --> 00:31:21,662
You turned off the water for me, didn’t you?

683
00:31:23,856 --> 00:31:24,435
Me?

684
00:31:24,725 --> 00:31:25,263
Yeah.

685
00:31:25,897 --> 00:31:27,503
I remember your shoes.

686
00:31:29,402 --> 00:31:31,057
I called you, but you wouldn’t stop and wait.

687
00:31:31,179 --> 00:31:32,314
You ignored me.

688
00:31:33,385 --> 00:31:34,042
I don’t get it.

689
00:31:34,470 --> 00:31:35,425
Is it because you’re famous now?

690
00:31:36,459 --> 00:31:37,402
That wasn’t me.

691
00:31:38,967 --> 00:31:39,585
That wasn’t you?

692
00:31:39,915 --> 00:31:40,420
No.

693
00:31:41,280 --> 00:31:41,822
Hey.

694
00:31:42,288 --> 00:31:42,783
Hey.

695
00:31:42,955 --> 00:31:43,598
What are you doing?

696
00:31:44,189 --> 00:31:45,440
I remember your smell.

697
00:31:46,050 --> 00:31:46,899
It was exactly this smell.

698
00:31:47,437 --> 00:31:48,354
That wasn’t me.

699
00:31:48,838 --> 00:31:50,324
That was my older brother Yotha.

700
00:31:53,517 --> 00:31:54,111
Yotha?

701
00:31:56,500 --> 00:31:57,180
Are you done?

702
00:31:58,382 --> 00:31:59,749
You should eat.

703
00:32:01,642 --> 00:32:02,205
Why?

704
00:32:03,802 --> 00:32:04,900
You’re too thin.

705
00:32:05,300 --> 00:32:06,601
Don’t let them say you don’t have anything to eat.

706
00:32:11,546 --> 00:32:13,302
Hey, why are you and your brother both freshmen?

707
00:32:13,620 --> 00:32:14,300
Did he start over here?

708
00:32:14,791 --> 00:32:15,299
No.

709
00:32:15,995 --> 00:32:17,622
We were born at the beginning
and the end of the same year,

710
00:32:17,720 --> 00:32:18,677
so we’re studying in the same year.

711
00:32:20,065 --> 00:32:21,471
You two are very similar.

712
00:32:22,402 --> 00:32:23,874
Of course. We’re brothers.

713
00:32:24,131 --> 00:32:24,965
Not only that,

714
00:32:25,251 --> 00:32:26,807
but our dad always gets us the same things—

715
00:32:27,157 --> 00:32:30,863
shoes, watches, and many more.

716
00:32:31,500 --> 00:32:32,805
I’m not surprised you mistook us for each other.

717
00:32:34,985 --> 00:32:37,494
But why don’t I see you with him?

718
00:32:38,216 --> 00:32:39,352
He hates crowded places.

719
00:32:39,681 --> 00:32:40,583
He says it’s too chaotic.

720
00:32:40,912 --> 00:32:42,084
He already left this morning.

721
00:32:45,124 --> 00:32:46,072
So damn mysterious.

722
00:32:46,776 --> 00:32:47,642
If I had to guess,

723
00:32:48,050 --> 00:32:50,717
I’d say he went to find
somewhere quiet and peaceful

724
00:32:50,730 --> 00:32:51,736
and he’s sleeping there alone.

725
00:32:53,933 --> 00:32:55,081
Here I come, guys.

726
00:32:55,103 --> 00:32:56,339
What did I miss?

727
00:32:56,760 --> 00:32:57,250
Hey.

728
00:32:58,783 --> 00:33:00,906
Your friend is trying to get info on my brother.

729
00:33:02,117 --> 00:33:03,514
The whole faculty knows

730
00:33:03,847 --> 00:33:05,269
that Faifa is in Electrical Engineering

731
00:33:05,558 --> 00:33:06,899
and Yotha is in Civil Engineering.

732
00:33:07,253 --> 00:33:08,317
Sorry, Fai.

733
00:33:08,720 --> 00:33:09,795
My friend here is a bit slow.

734
00:33:10,179 --> 00:33:10,914
It’s okay.

735
00:33:15,644 --> 00:33:16,539
Yotha.

736
00:33:34,346 --> 00:33:35,601
Who’s gossiping about me?

737
00:33:45,278 --> 00:33:46,134
Where’s Yotha?

738
00:33:46,514 --> 00:33:48,041
Don’t tell me he’s not even joining the activities.

739
00:33:48,866 --> 00:33:49,804
I don’t know.

740
00:33:50,082 --> 00:33:50,906
It depends on his mood.

741
00:33:51,539 --> 00:33:54,096
Hey. What kind of people do you think
our peer mentors will be?

742
00:33:54,557 --> 00:33:55,632
I just hope mine is kind

743
00:33:55,711 --> 00:33:57,712
and not like Fai’s brother
who doesn’t care about the world.

744
00:33:57,998 --> 00:33:59,303
That kind of person would be hard to get close to.

745
00:33:59,336 --> 00:34:01,013
You haven’t even met him
and you’re badmouthing him already.

746
00:34:01,749 --> 00:34:03,131
I can tell from just what you’ve told me.

747
00:34:03,961 --> 00:34:05,506
Why are you sitting here though?

748
00:34:05,730 --> 00:34:07,202
Your department is over there.

749
00:34:07,786 --> 00:34:08,432
Come on.

750
00:34:08,780 --> 00:34:09,702
Don’t chase me away. I’ll leave on my own.

751
00:34:09,722 --> 00:34:10,555
Chemical Engineering juniors,

752
00:34:10,577 --> 00:34:12,120
- get ready to come up on stage one by one.
- It’s time.

753
00:34:14,090 --> 00:34:15,296
Come on up, handsome.

754
00:34:16,891 --> 00:34:18,666
His smile steals my heart,

755
00:34:19,238 --> 00:34:20,300
It’s crazy.

756
00:34:20,837 --> 00:34:22,952
Please introduce yourself.

757
00:34:23,869 --> 00:34:25,497
I’m Gun Gunyukhol.

758
00:34:25,730 --> 00:34:27,939
Okay.

759
00:34:28,964 --> 00:34:31,288
Let’s find out which group he will be in.

760
00:34:31,311 --> 00:34:32,635
Draw lots and give it to me.

761
00:34:33,992 --> 00:34:35,693
Wow, I thought you wouldn’t come.

762
00:34:35,910 --> 00:34:38,165
- Knight in shining armor.
- Your peer mentor’s code is

763
00:34:38,240 --> 00:34:39,010
What are you talking about?

764
00:34:39,149 --> 00:34:42,485
0513.

765
00:34:44,470 --> 00:34:45,946
You’re the one who helped my friend, right?

766
00:34:45,974 --> 00:34:47,191
Where’s the peer mentor?

767
00:34:47,219 --> 00:34:49,191
Come to see your junior.

768
00:34:50,977 --> 00:34:52,047
I was walking out of the restroom.

769
00:34:52,715 --> 00:34:54,124
If I didn’t help turn it off,

770
00:34:54,768 --> 00:34:55,863
I would’ve gotten wet too.

771
00:34:56,911 --> 00:34:57,420
I see.

772
00:34:58,117 --> 00:34:59,103
That makes sense.

773
00:35:00,122 --> 00:35:03,201
You’re not one to care about anyone else.

774
00:35:03,240 --> 00:35:05,028
His peer mentor is finally here.

775
00:35:06,976 --> 00:35:12,517
He’s Sam, vice president of Year 2.

776
00:35:12,804 --> 00:35:15,161
He’s handsome, cheerful, nice, and friendly.

777
00:35:15,183 --> 00:35:17,866
More importantly, he’s a drunkie.

778
00:35:19,625 --> 00:35:21,248
Let me tell you, this one is a big drinker.

779
00:35:21,444 --> 00:35:22,774
They’re a perfect match.

780
00:35:22,992 --> 00:35:25,628
They’re both super handsome.

781
00:35:25,808 --> 00:35:28,322
Oh, he’s wrapping him in three-colored cloth.

782
00:35:28,594 --> 00:35:30,496
When he gets down from the stage,
you guys might want to greet him.

783
00:35:30,565 --> 00:35:31,601
He looks like a district officer.

784
00:35:33,327 --> 00:35:33,920
Look at him.

785
00:35:34,710 --> 00:35:37,007
Why is it taking so long for someone
to join the Perfect 10 Liners this year?

786
00:35:38,705 --> 00:35:39,234
Yeah.

787
00:35:43,370 --> 00:35:44,801
Maybe that person isn’t lucky enough.

788
00:35:47,182 --> 00:35:48,097
Stop exaggerating.

789
00:35:51,200 --> 00:35:51,727
This is for you.

790
00:35:52,810 --> 00:35:53,620
Thank you.

791
00:35:53,991 --> 00:35:55,444
I’m Sam from Industrial Engineering.

792
00:35:55,674 --> 00:35:56,503
I’m from Chemical Engineering.

793
00:35:56,521 --> 00:35:57,100
My name is Gun.

794
00:35:59,099 --> 00:35:59,820
Let’s talk downstairs.

795
00:35:59,854 --> 00:36:02,234
Let’s make some noise for them.

796
00:36:06,020 --> 00:36:06,488
Oh.

797
00:36:07,394 --> 00:36:09,183
I’ll bring you the lecture notes later.

798
00:36:09,616 --> 00:36:10,370
Thank you.

799
00:36:12,084 --> 00:36:14,321
By the way, when can I take this off?

800
00:36:15,600 --> 00:36:16,494
It’s just for content.

801
00:36:17,653 --> 00:36:19,709
You already got off stage so you can take it off.

802
00:36:20,383 --> 00:36:21,245
I didn’t know that.

803
00:36:22,143 --> 00:36:23,102
Where are you going after this?

804
00:36:24,988 --> 00:36:25,561
I don’t know.

805
00:36:25,598 --> 00:36:26,346
I’ll go where my friends go.

806
00:36:26,853 --> 00:36:28,020
You can take care of yourself, right?

807
00:36:28,725 --> 00:36:29,254
Yes.

808
00:36:29,448 --> 00:36:30,202
Good. I’m leaving.

809
00:36:31,528 --> 00:36:34,032
I was going to wait to see the Perfect 10 Liners,

810
00:36:35,057 --> 00:36:36,128
but it’s taking so long.

811
00:36:36,269 --> 00:36:37,007
I don’t want to wait anymore.

812
00:36:37,874 --> 00:36:38,697
The Perfect 10 Liners?

813
00:36:38,722 --> 00:36:39,765
I’m leaving. See you around.

814
00:36:41,217 --> 00:36:42,139
Okay.

815
00:36:42,226 --> 00:36:42,914
Bye.

816
00:36:43,120 --> 00:36:44,059
Pay respect to the Buddha.

817
00:36:44,242 --> 00:36:44,997
I’m paying respect to you.

818
00:36:45,357 --> 00:36:47,487
Let’s invite the next junior.

819
00:36:47,508 --> 00:36:50,377
Next, please.

820
00:36:51,152 --> 00:36:52,377
Do you want to go over there?

821
00:36:52,634 --> 00:36:53,115
Shall we?

822
00:36:54,093 --> 00:36:54,717
Okay.

823
00:36:55,728 --> 00:36:57,965
But if you go over there, you can’t smile.

824
00:36:58,802 --> 00:36:59,365
Why not?

825
00:37:00,402 --> 00:37:01,117
Because I’m possessive of you.

826
00:37:01,428 --> 00:37:02,097
Your smile is cute.

827
00:37:02,579 --> 00:37:03,659
I want to keep it for myself.

828
00:37:07,985 --> 00:37:08,823
Alright.

829
00:37:09,562 --> 00:37:10,056
Let’s go.

830
00:37:17,758 --> 00:37:18,601
Here he comes.

831
00:37:18,760 --> 00:37:20,268
Look at him.

832
00:37:21,629 --> 00:37:22,545
He’s so handsome.

833
00:37:22,690 --> 00:37:23,762
My heart has four chambers.

834
00:37:23,797 --> 00:37:24,685
Enough.

835
00:37:25,004 --> 00:37:26,567
- I’ll make more space for you.
- Stop.

836
00:37:27,400 --> 00:37:28,921
Please introduce yourself.

837
00:37:29,648 --> 00:37:31,493
My name is Yotha. I’m from Civil Engineering.

838
00:37:31,570 --> 00:37:32,899
Yes!

839
00:37:34,139 --> 00:37:36,774
Yotha, let’s find out which group you’re in.

840
00:37:38,515 --> 00:37:39,219
Okay.

841
00:37:40,380 --> 00:37:42,955
Yotha’s peer mentor code is

842
00:37:43,358 --> 00:37:45,909
0775.

843
00:37:47,733 --> 00:37:48,755
Hey, Arc!

844
00:37:48,771 --> 00:37:49,562
That’s my peer mentee.

845
00:37:49,754 --> 00:37:50,325
I should go up there.

846
00:37:51,022 --> 00:37:52,091
Don’t run, Arm! You might fall.

847
00:37:52,379 --> 00:37:52,973
I won’t.

848
00:38:01,177 --> 00:38:01,936
Yotha, right?

849
00:38:02,490 --> 00:38:04,468
Welcome to Perfect 10 Liners.

850
00:38:06,266 --> 00:38:07,450
Perfect 10 Liners?

851
00:38:07,645 --> 00:38:08,219
Here.

852
00:38:10,240 --> 00:38:10,853
Take this too.

853
00:38:12,370 --> 00:38:15,011
And this is your gift.

854
00:38:17,745 --> 00:38:18,472
You must be confused.

855
00:38:19,022 --> 00:38:20,485
I was too when I joined.

856
00:38:20,866 --> 00:38:22,703
I’ll explain later.

857
00:38:23,709 --> 00:38:25,511
- Okay.
- Let’s make some noise for them!

858
00:38:31,041 --> 00:38:32,628
Both the senior and the junior are amazing.

859
00:38:33,045 --> 00:38:34,404
I want to take them home.

860
00:38:34,518 --> 00:38:35,017
Calm down.

861
00:38:36,954 --> 00:38:38,755
That’s Yotha.

862
00:38:42,666 --> 00:38:43,765
Does he seem as mysterious as you thought?

863
00:38:59,397 --> 00:39:00,311
Stop staring.

864
00:39:00,829 --> 00:39:03,466
When you meet him, don’t stare at his face like that.

865
00:39:03,960 --> 00:39:05,148
He doesn’t like anyone staring at his face.

866
00:39:05,734 --> 00:39:06,555
What happens if I stare?

867
00:39:06,728 --> 00:39:07,740
He’ll beat you up.

868
00:39:08,517 --> 00:39:09,303
Beat me up?

869
00:39:10,177 --> 00:39:10,859
Just kidding

870
00:39:13,816 --> 00:39:16,057
When the activities end, can we leave right away?

871
00:39:16,613 --> 00:39:17,537
I think we can

872
00:39:17,724 --> 00:39:18,613
but I’ll leave later,

873
00:39:18,709 --> 00:39:19,711
My peer mentor asked me to eat with him.

874
00:39:20,488 --> 00:39:21,232
Then I’ll leave right away.

875
00:39:21,622 --> 00:39:22,299
My peer mentor already left.

876
00:39:22,318 --> 00:39:22,724
Okay.

877
00:39:22,743 --> 00:39:23,309
Hey.

878
00:39:24,708 --> 00:39:26,666
Looks like we both got ditched by our peer mentors.

879
00:39:27,037 --> 00:39:27,826
But it’s okay.

880
00:39:28,192 --> 00:39:29,905
I’ll take care of you.

881
00:39:30,527 --> 00:39:31,010
Huh?

882
00:39:31,494 --> 00:39:33,010
I don’t want to eat alone.

883
00:39:34,665 --> 00:39:35,570
What about your peer mentor?

884
00:39:36,429 --> 00:39:38,222
My peer mentor is going with the others.

885
00:39:38,600 --> 00:39:40,472
It’s only you and me left.

886
00:39:47,282 --> 00:39:47,857
Yotha.

887
00:39:48,558 --> 00:39:49,102
Yotha.

888
00:39:49,811 --> 00:39:50,315
Yes?

889
00:39:51,170 --> 00:39:52,940
Do you have a nickname?

890
00:39:52,958 --> 00:39:54,475
Or is Yotha also your nickname?

891
00:39:56,742 --> 00:39:57,616
It’s my nickname.

892
00:39:59,405 --> 00:40:00,500
That’s so cool, right, Arc?

893
00:40:01,194 --> 00:40:03,401
So your name is Yotha.
Are you in Civil Engineering?

894
00:40:04,491 --> 00:40:04,968
Yes.

895
00:40:04,988 --> 00:40:05,638
Great.

896
00:40:05,765 --> 00:40:07,201
Arc is in Civil Engineering too.

897
00:40:07,331 --> 00:40:09,072
He can help you with anything.

898
00:40:09,505 --> 00:40:11,530
Don’t forget to give him your lecture notes.

899
00:40:11,940 --> 00:40:13,281
They’re all with you.

900
00:40:15,191 --> 00:40:16,413
Why do you have to ruin it?

901
00:40:19,185 --> 00:40:20,411
Hey, Yotha.

902
00:40:20,671 --> 00:40:21,874
You have a younger brother, right?

903
00:40:22,189 --> 00:40:24,068
Yes, his name is Faifa.

904
00:40:25,459 --> 00:40:26,268
He’s in the same year.

905
00:40:28,905 --> 00:40:32,807
Don’t tell me he’s in Electrical Engineering
like his name suggests.

906
00:40:34,696 --> 00:40:36,204
That’s cool.

907
00:40:37,290 --> 00:40:40,315
Wow, your parents have planned this
since before you guys were born, huh?

908
00:40:43,425 --> 00:40:44,413
Hey, Yotha.

909
00:40:45,682 --> 00:40:46,268
Hi, guys.

910
00:40:46,671 --> 00:40:47,174
Hi.

911
00:40:47,576 --> 00:40:48,579
Hi.

912
00:40:49,136 --> 00:40:49,887
I’m Faifa,

913
00:40:50,040 --> 00:40:51,490
Yotha’s younger brother.

914
00:40:51,790 --> 00:40:54,091
This is my friend Gun.

915
00:40:54,912 --> 00:40:57,182
Did your peer mentors bring you kids here too?

916
00:40:58,447 --> 00:40:59,804
How dare you call them kids.

917
00:41:00,145 --> 00:41:02,499
You’re the most childish one at this table, Arm.

918
00:41:04,117 --> 00:41:08,122
We got ditched by our peer mentors

919
00:41:08,430 --> 00:41:10,586
so we came to get something to eat
before going back to our dorm.

920
00:41:10,811 --> 00:41:12,365
That’s so sad.

921
00:41:12,720 --> 00:41:14,573
Come.

922
00:41:14,927 --> 00:41:15,521
Sit with us.

923
00:41:15,554 --> 00:41:16,327
It’s Arc’s treat.

924
00:41:16,346 --> 00:41:17,288
We don’t want to trouble him.

925
00:41:18,232 --> 00:41:19,152
You should be worried about troubling me.

926
00:41:19,401 --> 00:41:21,920
I’ve strained my neck from
looking up to talk to you. Come.

927
00:41:22,223 --> 00:41:23,077
Have a seat, Gun.

928
00:41:23,542 --> 00:41:24,028
Come on.

929
00:41:27,226 --> 00:41:29,794
Faifa, you’re in Electrical Engineering, right?

930
00:41:30,174 --> 00:41:30,645
Yes.

931
00:41:31,010 --> 00:41:32,408
What about you, Gun?

932
00:41:33,502 --> 00:41:34,469
Chemical Engineering.

933
00:41:35,011 --> 00:41:37,700
Wow. Chemical Engineering is tough.

934
00:41:38,136 --> 00:41:40,065
You’re impressive for getting in.

935
00:41:42,900 --> 00:41:43,533
Thank you.

936
00:41:45,288 --> 00:41:46,737
When you interviewed,

937
00:41:47,465 --> 00:41:49,398
did the professors ask you any weird questions?

938
00:41:49,774 --> 00:41:50,469
Only normal ones.

939
00:41:50,869 --> 00:41:52,469
Same for me.

940
00:41:52,653 --> 00:41:53,157
Really?

941
00:41:54,979 --> 00:41:56,100
See? I told you.

942
00:41:56,420 --> 00:41:58,002
No one was asked anything weird like you were,

943
00:41:58,346 --> 00:41:59,573
Anon, the debt-free.

944
00:42:00,490 --> 00:42:01,720
It’s “the person who has no debt.”

945
00:42:01,810 --> 00:42:03,720
You never get it right.
Don’t make me kiss you on the lips.

946
00:42:04,561 --> 00:42:05,402
You may not have debts,

947
00:42:05,788 --> 00:42:06,499
but you have me.

948
00:42:08,684 --> 00:42:09,962
What an old joke.

949
00:42:11,157 --> 00:42:11,848
But I love it.

950
00:42:11,860 --> 00:42:12,706
Keep it coming.

951
00:42:14,611 --> 00:42:16,598
Are you Anon, the debt-free?

952
00:42:17,139 --> 00:42:18,500
Yes, why?

953
00:42:18,564 --> 00:42:19,811
You’ve heard of it before?

954
00:42:26,637 --> 00:42:27,625
Stop patting too much

955
00:42:27,641 --> 00:42:28,337
or I’ll throw up.

956
00:42:28,451 --> 00:42:29,240
Come on.

957
00:42:29,325 --> 00:42:29,952
It’ll be over soon

958
00:42:31,034 --> 00:42:31,899
You’re not one to talk.

959
00:42:32,320 --> 00:42:34,109
You’re done but your legs are still shaking.

960
00:42:36,690 --> 00:42:37,500
They’re not shaking.

961
00:42:38,656 --> 00:42:40,234
Last applicant for Chemical Engineering.

962
00:42:40,311 --> 00:42:42,217
Mr. Gunyukhol Jiraroj, please come in.

963
00:42:43,411 --> 00:42:43,965
Listen.

964
00:42:44,740 --> 00:42:45,576
You can do it.

965
00:42:50,468 --> 00:42:51,266
- I got this!
- You got this!

966
00:42:51,773 --> 00:42:52,620
I can do it!

967
00:42:58,918 --> 00:42:59,509
Hello.

968
00:43:00,749 --> 00:43:03,408
Please introduce yourself.

969
00:43:05,934 --> 00:43:07,072
Hello again.

970
00:43:07,441 --> 00:43:09,047
I’m Gunyukhol Jiraroj.

971
00:43:14,988 --> 00:43:15,699
Uh…

972
00:43:16,300 --> 00:43:17,887
My nickname is Gun,

973
00:43:18,244 --> 00:43:20,105
which is short for my first name.

974
00:43:20,520 --> 00:43:23,511
And just in case you don’t know,

975
00:43:24,727 --> 00:43:26,251
Gunyukhol means two ears.

976
00:43:29,690 --> 00:43:33,048
The professors said there was someone
with an unusual name like mine last year.

977
00:43:33,391 --> 00:43:34,888
Wow.

978
00:43:35,911 --> 00:43:37,940
We really are the legends of engineering.

979
00:43:38,388 --> 00:43:40,198
Nice to meet you, Junior.

980
00:43:41,631 --> 00:43:42,888
Nice to meet you too, Senior.

981
00:43:46,739 --> 00:43:47,490
Let’s eat.

982
00:43:47,909 --> 00:43:49,324
Can we get two more rice?

983
00:44:18,743 --> 00:44:19,201
Oh.

984
00:44:20,244 --> 00:44:21,232
His bag is here.

985
00:44:23,659 --> 00:44:24,211
Hello?

986
00:44:24,825 --> 00:44:25,480
Where are you?

987
00:44:25,671 --> 00:44:27,202
(I’m waiting for my senior’s lecture notes,)

988
00:44:27,420 --> 00:44:28,041
(then I’ll head up.)

989
00:44:28,432 --> 00:44:29,045
Okay.

990
00:44:31,894 --> 00:44:32,736
I’m going to take a shower.

991
00:44:45,841 --> 00:44:46,494
I’m sleepy.

992
00:44:48,811 --> 00:44:49,293
Hey.

993
00:44:50,207 --> 00:44:51,037
Are you going to the bar?

994
00:44:51,760 --> 00:44:52,240
Yeah.

995
00:44:52,496 --> 00:44:54,388
Are you sleeping here tonight or at the bar?

996
00:44:55,102 --> 00:44:55,896
Probably the bar.

997
00:44:57,431 --> 00:44:58,410
Call me if you need anything.

998
00:45:10,965 --> 00:45:11,448
Hey.

999
00:45:11,671 --> 00:45:12,170
Hmm?

1000
00:45:13,340 --> 00:45:15,071
Can I see what’s inside the box?

1001
00:45:15,434 --> 00:45:15,957
Sure.

1002
00:45:27,194 --> 00:45:28,103
So cute.

1003
00:45:33,069 --> 00:45:34,700
When you sleep here, can you wear these?

1004
00:45:37,022 --> 00:45:38,324
Today I drew lots to get into
a peer mentoring group

1005
00:45:38,611 --> 00:45:40,170
and then went out to eat with my friends.

1006
00:45:40,551 --> 00:45:42,714
As soon as I got out of the shower, I called you.

1007
00:45:43,170 --> 00:45:44,952
(Have you made new friends?)

1008
00:45:45,320 --> 00:45:47,748
I’ll probably get to know
new people in the core classes.

1009
00:45:48,216 --> 00:45:49,361
But right now, I only know Kong

1010
00:45:49,380 --> 00:45:51,297
and our new friend Faifa.

1011
00:45:51,936 --> 00:45:53,297
(Only one new friend?)

1012
00:45:54,120 --> 00:45:57,271
Actually, there’s one more named Yotha.

1013
00:46:03,598 --> 00:46:04,702
(Is something wrong?)

1014
00:46:06,405 --> 00:46:07,783
No, Mom.

1015
00:46:08,376 --> 00:46:10,475
I’m just sleepy.

1016
00:46:12,103 --> 00:46:13,451
(Then sleep.)

1017
00:46:13,725 --> 00:46:14,823
(Let’s talk tomorrow.)

1018
00:46:15,032 --> 00:46:16,157
(I love you, son.)

1019
00:46:16,382 --> 00:46:17,176
I love you too, Mom.

1020
00:46:43,195 --> 00:46:44,395
The power on our floor went out.

1021
00:46:44,758 --> 00:46:45,398
I know.

1022
00:46:45,771 --> 00:46:46,718
It’ll be back at 5 a.m. tomorrow.

1023
00:46:47,222 --> 00:46:48,032
Did they announce that?

1024
00:46:48,232 --> 00:46:49,674
Yes, in the group chat.

1025
00:46:50,960 --> 00:46:52,600
You should start paying
attention to these things.

1026
00:46:53,877 --> 00:46:55,896
You pay too much attention to everything.

1027
00:46:56,160 --> 00:46:57,228
Come in.

1028
00:47:00,084 --> 00:47:01,179
What’s going on?

1029
00:47:03,431 --> 00:47:04,745
Gun can’t sleep without the lights on,

1030
00:47:04,927 --> 00:47:07,120
so I’m leaving him here.

1031
00:47:08,441 --> 00:47:10,028
Why can’t you sleep without the lights on?

1032
00:47:11,588 --> 00:47:12,814
It’s a long story.

1033
00:47:14,389 --> 00:47:16,522
But if you can’t sleep with the lights on, it’s okay.

1034
00:47:16,914 --> 00:47:17,611
I’ll go…

1035
00:47:17,631 --> 00:47:18,250
It’s fine.

1036
00:47:18,820 --> 00:47:20,214
Yotha is not coming back tonight.

1037
00:47:20,256 --> 00:47:21,111
You can sleep in his bed.

1038
00:47:21,554 --> 00:47:22,635
What about you, Kong?

1039
00:47:22,945 --> 00:47:24,435
It’s hot. Do you want to sleep here with us?

1040
00:47:24,454 --> 00:47:25,256
No, I’ll be fine.

1041
00:47:25,472 --> 00:47:26,546
I have a celebrity portable fan.

1042
00:47:27,112 --> 00:47:27,617
Here.

1043
00:47:30,983 --> 00:47:31,703
How’s that?

1044
00:47:31,764 --> 00:47:32,472
Cold, right?

1045
00:47:33,804 --> 00:47:36,265
Please take care of him.

1046
00:47:37,170 --> 00:47:37,608
See you.

1047
00:47:37,669 --> 00:47:38,186
Okay.

1048
00:47:38,804 --> 00:47:39,328
Bye.

1049
00:47:39,394 --> 00:47:39,927
Bye.

1050
00:47:42,668 --> 00:47:43,743
Make yourself at home.

1051
00:47:44,875 --> 00:47:46,925
Why isn’t Yotha coming back to the dorm?

1052
00:47:47,411 --> 00:47:48,207
Don’t they check attendance?

1053
00:47:49,256 --> 00:47:50,757
He doesn’t care about these things.

1054
00:47:52,084 --> 00:47:52,853
Where is he?

1055
00:47:53,065 --> 00:47:53,613
Did he go home?

1056
00:47:55,392 --> 00:47:56,826
His story is as long as yours

1057
00:47:56,845 --> 00:47:58,921
about not being able to
sleep without the lights on.

1058
00:48:00,070 --> 00:48:01,478
Just forget it.

1059
00:48:02,071 --> 00:48:02,666
Let’s sleep.

1060
00:48:06,782 --> 00:48:07,765
I’ll sleep on the floor.

1061
00:48:08,016 --> 00:48:09,177
I don’t want to trouble Yotha.

1062
00:48:09,238 --> 00:48:10,672
Don’t worry about him.

1063
00:48:10,693 --> 00:48:11,912
He’s not coming back tonight.

1064
00:48:12,219 --> 00:48:14,457
So, should I keep all the lights on

1065
00:48:14,472 --> 00:48:15,893
or can I leave just the lamps on?

1066
00:48:18,586 --> 00:48:19,508
Just the lamps are enough.

1067
00:48:19,850 --> 00:48:20,457
Are you sure?

1068
00:48:20,517 --> 00:48:20,973
Yeah.

1069
00:48:20,989 --> 00:48:21,520
Okay.

1070
00:48:22,035 --> 00:48:22,857
Thank you.

1071
00:48:27,703 --> 00:48:28,453
You’re okay, right?

1072
00:48:29,634 --> 00:48:30,222
Yes.

1073
00:48:30,653 --> 00:48:31,194
I’m okay.

1074
00:48:31,842 --> 00:48:32,718
Make yourself at home.

1075
00:48:32,734 --> 00:48:33,395
Good night.

1076
00:48:33,680 --> 00:48:34,474
I should sleep.

1077
00:48:40,431 --> 00:48:42,160
May I, Mr. Darkness?

1078
00:48:53,662 --> 00:48:54,373
Just sleep, Gun.

1079
00:49:45,954 --> 00:49:46,454
Hey.

1080
00:49:48,142 --> 00:49:48,651
Hey.

1081
00:49:52,915 --> 00:49:53,365
Gun.

1082
00:49:54,869 --> 00:49:55,376
Gun.

1083
00:50:01,260 --> 00:50:01,768
Gun.

1084
00:50:03,330 --> 00:50:03,817
Gun.

1085
00:50:04,761 --> 00:50:05,315
Gun, wake up.

1086
00:50:08,038 --> 00:50:08,521
Gun.

1087
00:50:21,943 --> 00:50:23,282
Hi, new roommate.

1088
00:50:23,711 --> 00:50:24,760
Let me tie it for you.

1089
00:50:26,736 --> 00:50:27,315
Nuisance.

1090
00:50:28,277 --> 00:50:29,601
Don’t tell me you like this kind of thing.

1091
00:50:31,573 --> 00:50:32,231
Meddler.

1092
00:50:33,854 --> 00:50:34,933
Is something going on, Arc?

1093
00:50:36,977 --> 00:50:38,367
Let me hug you tightly before I tell you.

1094
00:50:38,619 --> 00:50:39,202
Tie it for me.

1095
00:50:39,557 --> 00:50:40,801
When you think of Engineering,

1096
00:50:41,037 --> 00:50:42,308
what’s the first thing that comes to mind?

1097
00:50:42,521 --> 00:50:43,060
You.

1098
00:50:45,481 --> 00:50:46,348
The number one

1099
00:50:47,047 --> 00:50:48,875
troublemaker in Engineering.
