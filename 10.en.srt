1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,910
My name is Faifa.

2
00:00:00,930 --> 00:00:01,710
I’m Gun.

3
00:00:01,730 --> 00:00:02,400
He’s Kong.

4
00:00:02,430 --> 00:00:04,090
Why are you and your brother both freshmen?

5
00:00:04,110 --> 00:00:05,710
We were born at the beginning
and the end of the same year.

6
00:00:05,740 --> 00:00:06,850
Yotha, right?

7
00:00:06,870 --> 00:00:09,080
Welcome to Perfect 10 Liners.

8
00:00:09,840 --> 00:00:11,340
Why do you sleep with the lights on?

9
00:00:11,380 --> 00:00:14,460
I just don’t like
not being able to see what’s around me.

10
00:00:24,200 --> 00:00:24,730
Gun.

11
00:00:27,020 --> 00:00:27,610
Gun.

12
00:00:32,960 --> 00:00:34,670
You said you’d be able to sleep.

13
00:00:34,700 --> 00:00:35,880
I’m sorry.

14
00:00:37,490 --> 00:00:38,830
I didn’t want to bother you.

15
00:00:40,830 --> 00:00:41,890
And you said you wouldn’t come back tonight.

16
00:00:43,710 --> 00:00:45,020
I changed my mind.

17
00:00:49,960 --> 00:00:50,910
I’ll go back to my room.

18
00:00:50,930 --> 00:00:52,100
No.

19
00:00:55,020 --> 00:00:56,510
You can’t sleep with the lights off, can you?

20
00:00:57,000 --> 00:00:59,710
Well, Yotha is back.

21
00:00:59,740 --> 00:01:00,990
I don’t want to bother him.

22
00:01:09,110 --> 00:01:10,180
Thank you, twins.

23
00:01:11,260 --> 00:01:12,430
We’re not twins.

24
00:01:12,840 --> 00:01:13,590
Come on.

25
00:01:13,630 --> 00:01:15,370
Your names are long.

26
00:01:15,400 --> 00:01:16,920
It’s tiring to pronounce.

27
00:01:16,930 --> 00:01:17,790
Can’t I just call you twins?

28
00:01:17,810 --> 00:01:19,150
It’s not like Gunyukhol is short.

29
00:01:22,520 --> 00:01:26,120
Anyway, thank you both so much
for saving my life tonight.

30
00:01:27,280 --> 00:01:28,130
Goodnight.

31
00:01:28,570 --> 00:01:30,130
Stop talking and sleep already.

32
00:01:32,270 --> 00:01:33,470
Good night, Yotha.

33
00:01:34,060 --> 00:01:35,160
Don’t have nightmares.

34
00:03:46,360 --> 00:03:47,320
Thank you, twins.

35
00:04:16,180 --> 00:04:17,460
Wake up!

36
00:04:17,490 --> 00:04:18,890
Wake up, Kong!

37
00:04:20,760 --> 00:04:21,220
Gun!

38
00:04:24,810 --> 00:04:25,270
What?

39
00:04:25,300 --> 00:04:25,760
Hey!

40
00:04:25,800 --> 00:04:26,220
What?

41
00:04:26,240 --> 00:04:26,700
Get out!

42
00:04:26,720 --> 00:04:27,450
Get out!

43
00:04:27,620 --> 00:04:28,430
Fine.

44
00:04:28,460 --> 00:04:29,620
I’ll go back to sleep.

45
00:04:31,350 --> 00:04:33,040
Wake up, Kong!

46
00:04:34,080 --> 00:04:34,750
Gun!

47
00:04:39,040 --> 00:04:39,440
Let’s go!

48
00:04:39,460 --> 00:04:39,730
Come on!

49
00:04:40,540 --> 00:04:41,950
Hold on!

50
00:04:41,960 --> 00:04:42,720
What?

51
00:04:42,740 --> 00:04:43,330
What?

52
00:04:43,500 --> 00:04:44,810
I forgot my phone.

53
00:04:44,830 --> 00:04:45,920
Give me a second.

54
00:04:45,960 --> 00:04:46,800
Hurry up!

55
00:04:46,820 --> 00:04:47,810
I will!

56
00:04:53,210 --> 00:04:53,900
Hi.

57
00:04:54,220 --> 00:04:55,390
Are you going to class?

58
00:04:55,400 --> 00:04:56,890
Me too.

59
00:04:56,910 --> 00:04:58,380
I’m waiting for Kong to get this stuff.

60
00:05:00,520 --> 00:05:01,880
How are you getting to uni?

61
00:05:02,240 --> 00:05:03,180
Do you want to go with me?

62
00:05:03,200 --> 00:05:03,710
I have a car.

63
00:05:03,740 --> 00:05:04,480
I have a car too.

64
00:05:06,100 --> 00:05:07,370
Wait.

65
00:05:07,880 --> 00:05:08,560
Hold on.

66
00:05:10,010 --> 00:05:11,170
Did you forget to wear your tie?

67
00:05:11,770 --> 00:05:12,730
I didn’t forget.

68
00:05:14,090 --> 00:05:15,580
Then why aren’t you wearing it?

69
00:05:21,470 --> 00:05:22,300
I don’t know how to tie it.

70
00:05:22,940 --> 00:05:23,510
Huh?

71
00:05:24,420 --> 00:05:25,200
I don’t know how to tie it.

72
00:05:26,650 --> 00:05:27,120
Huh?

73
00:05:28,140 --> 00:05:29,370
I don’t know how to tie it.

74
00:05:43,510 --> 00:05:44,860
This is our first class with everyone.

75
00:05:45,450 --> 00:05:46,760
I hope we make new friends.

76
00:05:46,780 --> 00:05:47,730
Sadhu.

77
00:05:48,260 --> 00:05:49,640
Do you think we can make any friends?

78
00:05:50,110 --> 00:05:51,070
Of course, we can.

79
00:05:51,370 --> 00:05:53,660
- Just act smart and don’t be funny.

80
00:05:53,680 --> 00:05:54,130
Okay.

81
00:05:54,160 --> 00:05:54,990
Follow me.

82
00:06:00,180 --> 00:06:01,880
And he told me not to be funny.

83
00:06:04,080 --> 00:06:05,440
Are you alright?

84
00:06:05,470 --> 00:06:06,470
Try to get up slowly.

85
00:06:08,150 --> 00:06:08,970
It doesn’t hurt.

86
00:06:08,990 --> 00:06:09,480
It doesn’t hurt.

87
00:06:09,500 --> 00:06:10,780
It doesn’t hurt?

88
00:06:12,760 --> 00:06:14,190
Are you sure it doesn’t hurt?

89
00:06:17,550 --> 00:06:18,360
You looked totally off balance just now.

90
00:06:18,530 --> 00:06:20,190
Do you guys have anywhere to sit yet?

91
00:06:20,200 --> 00:06:21,020
You can join us.

92
00:06:21,050 --> 00:06:21,560
Yeah.

93
00:06:22,090 --> 00:06:22,730
Move.

94
00:06:24,680 --> 00:06:25,440
Ouch!

95
00:06:27,200 --> 00:06:27,820
We’re not funny.

96
00:06:28,840 --> 00:06:29,550
We’re not funny.

97
00:06:29,560 --> 00:06:30,270
We’re smart.

98
00:06:30,300 --> 00:06:31,050
We’re smart.

99
00:06:32,160 --> 00:06:34,540
I’m Book.

100
00:06:34,980 --> 00:06:36,210
This is Franc.

101
00:06:37,070 --> 00:06:38,210
I'm Kong.

102
00:06:38,240 --> 00:06:40,210
This clumsy one is Gun.

103
00:06:42,420 --> 00:06:43,050
Hi.

104
00:06:43,690 --> 00:06:44,650
Thanks for helping me.

105
00:06:44,680 --> 00:06:45,160
No worries.

106
00:06:47,790 --> 00:06:48,420
What?

107
00:06:57,920 --> 00:06:58,590
What’s wrong with him?

108
00:07:00,150 --> 00:07:01,610
He acts like he doesn’t know me

109
00:07:02,380 --> 00:07:03,050
when this morning I helped tie…

110
00:07:05,500 --> 00:07:07,500
Then why aren’t you wearing it?

111
00:07:07,530 --> 00:07:08,770
I don’t know how to tie it.

112
00:07:14,830 --> 00:07:15,690
Sorry.

113
00:07:17,360 --> 00:07:18,890
Did you bring your tie?

114
00:07:18,910 --> 00:07:19,710
Why do you ask?

115
00:07:23,510 --> 00:07:25,420
Hey, what are you doing?

116
00:07:25,450 --> 00:07:26,990
Come on. Let me tie it for you.

117
00:07:35,740 --> 00:07:37,850
If you showed up like this,
the teacher would scold you.

118
00:07:40,260 --> 00:07:41,850
If you hadn’t run into me,

119
00:07:42,280 --> 00:07:43,300
what would you have done?

120
00:08:21,830 --> 00:08:23,060
Done.

121
00:08:34,210 --> 00:08:34,840
Hey.

122
00:08:34,860 --> 00:08:35,900
What are you daydreaming about?

123
00:08:36,940 --> 00:08:37,690
Nothing.

124
00:08:40,040 --> 00:08:42,540
Are Yotha and Faifa really siblings?

125
00:08:42,560 --> 00:08:43,770
One is friendly,

126
00:08:43,790 --> 00:08:45,090
but the other is so introverted.

127
00:08:46,820 --> 00:08:50,990
You know the YothaFaifa brothers?

128
00:08:51,370 --> 00:08:51,790
Yeah.

129
00:08:52,400 --> 00:08:55,460
But you don’t know about their shady business?

130
00:08:56,160 --> 00:09:00,400
Rumor has it that their family is weird.

131
00:09:01,520 --> 00:09:04,780
The eldest brother opened a fancy bar as a front

132
00:09:04,810 --> 00:09:07,880
and Yotha is never seen with the same girl twice.

133
00:09:08,450 --> 00:09:08,970
But

134
00:09:09,860 --> 00:09:12,590
the girls he hangs out with suddenly disappear.

135
00:09:12,600 --> 00:09:13,490
Disappear?

136
00:09:13,530 --> 00:09:14,280
They disappear.

137
00:09:14,300 --> 00:09:14,770
Hey.

138
00:09:14,800 --> 00:09:15,870
Keep it down.

139
00:09:16,600 --> 00:09:17,810
Where do they disappear to?

140
00:09:17,840 --> 00:09:19,450
No idea.

141
00:09:25,360 --> 00:09:26,350
Huh?

142
00:09:28,770 --> 00:09:30,380
That can’t be.

143
00:09:37,600 --> 00:09:38,570
Do you have a pen?

144
00:09:39,070 --> 00:09:40,060
Can I borrow it?

145
00:09:45,330 --> 00:09:47,260
You guys already know the truth, don’t you?

146
00:09:47,610 --> 00:09:48,670
The truth?

147
00:09:49,390 --> 00:09:51,900
Is Yotha really a serial killer?

148
00:09:58,960 --> 00:10:01,520
Just kidding.

149
00:10:02,860 --> 00:10:04,570
Are you guys crazy?

150
00:10:05,010 --> 00:10:07,010
Yotha is just quiet

151
00:10:07,060 --> 00:10:08,690
and rarely socializes.

152
00:10:08,990 --> 00:10:11,460
It’s true that my brother has a bar though,

153
00:10:11,480 --> 00:10:13,050
but it’s not a front for anything.

154
00:10:13,070 --> 00:10:14,300
It’s almost gone bankrupt.

155
00:10:16,890 --> 00:10:18,020
I shouldn’t have believed the rumor.

156
00:10:18,060 --> 00:10:19,420
I could stab you.

157
00:10:20,250 --> 00:10:21,600
Give me your food.

158
00:10:21,620 --> 00:10:22,580
Just give it to me.

159
00:10:23,470 --> 00:10:25,870
Hey, do you have COVID, Newton?

160
00:10:26,170 --> 00:10:28,670
More like one of his brothers
is gossiping about him.

161
00:10:28,730 --> 00:10:29,890
Wa knows best.

162
00:10:30,240 --> 00:10:33,900
Try our newest cocktail, Nop.

163
00:10:34,320 --> 00:10:37,140
I’ve had so much to drink,
my kidneys are about to give out, dude.

164
00:10:38,040 --> 00:10:40,090
Do you want me to get drunk
before the bar even opens?

165
00:10:40,110 --> 00:10:40,870
Just taste it.

166
00:10:40,890 --> 00:10:41,880
Don’t complain.

167
00:10:45,430 --> 00:10:47,500
I told you not to come here in your student uniform.

168
00:10:49,290 --> 00:10:50,490
The bar is not open yet.

169
00:10:51,340 --> 00:10:52,990
I’m not used to seeing you in that uniform.

170
00:10:56,350 --> 00:10:57,860
You’ve grown so much, little brother.

171
00:11:15,070 --> 00:11:15,880
Hello?

172
00:11:16,060 --> 00:11:17,940
My peer mentor is treating me to karaoke.

173
00:11:17,970 --> 00:11:18,880
You can sleep now.

174
00:11:18,910 --> 00:11:19,800
No need to wait for me.

175
00:11:19,820 --> 00:11:20,410
Okay.

176
00:11:20,860 --> 00:11:22,890
Let me know if you can’t get back.

177
00:11:22,920 --> 00:11:23,590
I’ll pick you up.

178
00:11:23,620 --> 00:11:25,090
Alright, babe.

179
00:11:25,110 --> 00:11:25,830
Kisses.

180
00:11:25,860 --> 00:11:26,960
Babe, my ass.

181
00:11:26,990 --> 00:11:27,920
Stop it.

182
00:11:34,440 --> 00:11:35,400
Come on now.

183
00:11:51,230 --> 00:11:52,450
Shit!

184
00:11:53,240 --> 00:11:53,920
Shit!

185
00:11:53,960 --> 00:11:55,150
What’s wrong with you, Kong?

186
00:11:55,690 --> 00:11:58,190
Hi, two ears.

187
00:12:01,180 --> 00:12:03,740
Did you die in a car crash

188
00:12:03,760 --> 00:12:04,770
last night and didn’t realize it?

189
00:12:06,280 --> 00:12:07,790
I’m not dead.

190
00:12:07,820 --> 00:12:09,790
I just didn’t get any sleep.

191
00:12:12,090 --> 00:12:13,890
Stop waking me up!

192
00:12:14,350 --> 00:12:15,610
Why didn’t you sleep?

193
00:12:16,380 --> 00:12:18,890
Don’t tell me you couldn’t sleep
because I left the lights on?

194
00:12:18,910 --> 00:12:20,890
It’s fine.

195
00:12:21,160 --> 00:12:23,040
I’ll try again tonight.

196
00:12:24,790 --> 00:12:26,410
I’m sorry.

197
00:12:27,900 --> 00:12:29,780
Have you even gotten

198
00:12:30,330 --> 00:12:31,880
a full night's sleep since we moved in?

199
00:12:32,200 --> 00:12:39,010
Hmm.

200
00:12:39,720 --> 00:12:43,240
Sometimes yes, sometimes no.

201
00:12:44,340 --> 00:12:46,030
I'll ask to move to a different room.

202
00:12:47,500 --> 00:12:48,730
It’s totally fine.

203
00:12:48,750 --> 00:12:50,860
I’ll try again tonight.

204
00:12:50,890 --> 00:12:52,860
I’m going to take a shower now.

205
00:12:54,770 --> 00:12:55,900
Do you need help?

206
00:12:59,900 --> 00:13:01,610
A shower will make me feel refreshed

207
00:13:01,630 --> 00:13:02,590
and better.

208
00:13:03,120 --> 00:13:04,810
Refreshing.

209
00:13:05,230 --> 00:13:06,110
Shower.

210
00:13:06,490 --> 00:13:07,880
I should take a shower.

211
00:13:11,320 --> 00:13:13,890
I wanted to ask about our call this morning.

212
00:13:13,930 --> 00:13:16,720
I can pay double the rent.

213
00:13:16,750 --> 00:13:18,360
It’d be better for me to sleep alone
and not bother my friends.

214
00:13:18,380 --> 00:13:21,200
If there’s an available room,
you could probably do that,

215
00:13:21,230 --> 00:13:24,240
but right now, our dorm is full.

216
00:13:24,910 --> 00:13:28,910
Can I move off-campus as a special exception?

217
00:13:29,020 --> 00:13:30,790
I don’t want to make my friends uncomfortable.

218
00:13:30,810 --> 00:13:32,490
That’s against the rules.

219
00:13:36,810 --> 00:13:38,990
Hey, don’t be sad.

220
00:13:40,440 --> 00:13:43,150
Kong can stay with us in the meantime.

221
00:13:44,060 --> 00:13:45,890
Yeah, don’t worry.

222
00:13:50,390 --> 00:13:51,220
What’s going on?

223
00:13:54,530 --> 00:13:55,330
What’s wrong?

224
00:13:57,390 --> 00:13:59,000
Faifa.

225
00:14:03,740 --> 00:14:05,000
Oh, you’re here.

226
00:14:05,890 --> 00:14:06,900
Want to help me move out?

227
00:14:07,800 --> 00:14:10,860
You didn’t even ask before moving
someone else into the room with me.

228
00:14:11,290 --> 00:14:13,290
Calm down, brother.

229
00:14:13,330 --> 00:14:16,060
My friend has a problem
so I had to find a way to help him.

230
00:14:16,090 --> 00:14:17,450
What does that have to do with me?

231
00:14:17,480 --> 00:14:18,970
Come on, feel bad for Gun.

232
00:14:19,000 --> 00:14:20,830
No one can sleep in the same room with him.

233
00:14:20,850 --> 00:14:22,830
You’re hardly ever here anyway.

234
00:14:22,850 --> 00:14:24,520
What’s the big deal about sharing the room with him?

235
00:14:24,540 --> 00:14:26,280
You’re only asking for my willingness now.

236
00:14:26,830 --> 00:14:28,350
It’s not like I can say no.

237
00:14:29,290 --> 00:14:31,290
That means you’re not going to say no.

238
00:14:31,320 --> 00:14:33,520
Please take care of your new roommate.

239
00:14:33,550 --> 00:14:34,200
No.

240
00:14:35,140 --> 00:14:36,140
Bye.

241
00:14:37,900 --> 00:14:39,200
Don’t.

242
00:14:39,230 --> 00:14:40,320
It’s heavy.

243
00:14:40,350 --> 00:14:43,360
If you’re not helping, don’t make things worse.

244
00:14:43,400 --> 00:14:44,250
Bye-bye.

245
00:14:53,170 --> 00:14:55,000
Hi, new roommate.

246
00:15:12,350 --> 00:15:14,830
I’m sorry for putting you
and your brother in different rooms.

247
00:15:15,370 --> 00:15:16,030
It’s fine.

248
00:15:20,700 --> 00:15:22,380
As a thank you,

249
00:15:22,410 --> 00:15:23,600
I’ll be good

250
00:15:23,630 --> 00:15:25,600
and clean the room for you for a week.

251
00:15:25,630 --> 00:15:26,410
No need.

252
00:15:26,900 --> 00:15:28,140
I’m usually not here.

253
00:15:28,660 --> 00:15:29,470
Oh?

254
00:15:29,490 --> 00:15:30,720
Then where will you be?

255
00:15:32,060 --> 00:15:32,720
Don’t pry.

256
00:15:32,910 --> 00:15:34,360
I want to.

257
00:15:44,480 --> 00:15:45,480
Are you dating anyone?

258
00:15:49,780 --> 00:15:50,880
What did you say?

259
00:15:52,490 --> 00:15:55,100
I’m asking if you’re dating anyone.

260
00:16:04,670 --> 00:16:05,660
No.

261
00:16:07,380 --> 00:16:09,470
That sucks.

262
00:16:11,350 --> 00:16:12,550
Hurry up and find someone.

263
00:16:14,400 --> 00:16:17,550
Why should I?

264
00:16:18,000 --> 00:16:21,010
Because people in relationships
are usually busy with their partner

265
00:16:21,600 --> 00:16:23,430
and don’t have time to get into others’ business.

266
00:16:31,290 --> 00:16:32,090
Yotha.

267
00:16:32,990 --> 00:16:34,180
You’re calling me nosy.

268
00:16:35,710 --> 00:16:36,200
You!

269
00:16:40,920 --> 00:16:42,780
You’re sitting in my room lonely

270
00:16:42,810 --> 00:16:44,420
because Yotha didn’t come back, right?

271
00:16:46,140 --> 00:16:46,830
Yeah.

272
00:16:47,420 --> 00:16:48,380
Where is he?

273
00:16:48,400 --> 00:16:49,530
Back to his stomping grounds.

274
00:16:50,600 --> 00:16:51,780
Sleeping in a burrow?

275
00:16:53,870 --> 00:16:55,900
If I weren’t too lazy to lift my leg,

276
00:16:55,930 --> 00:16:57,450
I would kick your face.

277
00:16:59,000 --> 00:17:03,110
You can joke with me like this
but don’t ever do it with Yotha.

278
00:17:03,420 --> 00:17:04,410
He’d kick you for real.

279
00:17:06,270 --> 00:17:07,130
So cruel.

280
00:17:08,170 --> 00:17:12,080
You didn’t make me your brother’s roommate

281
00:17:12,720 --> 00:17:14,300
to trick me into getting killed, did you?

282
00:17:18,190 --> 00:17:19,420
Actually,

283
00:17:20,270 --> 00:17:22,270
it’s almost Sacrifice Day.

284
00:17:22,990 --> 00:17:26,380
Yotha needs the body of an innocent man.

285
00:17:29,050 --> 00:17:30,590
Perfect timing to be snoring.

286
00:17:30,900 --> 00:17:32,500
He’s really scary.

287
00:17:32,540 --> 00:17:33,830
I can confirm that.

288
00:17:33,870 --> 00:17:37,100
How are people supposed to believe
that your brother is not a serial killer?

289
00:17:37,900 --> 00:17:40,660
Why are you and he so different?

290
00:17:40,690 --> 00:17:42,860
I know, right?

291
00:17:44,700 --> 00:17:46,040
This is between us, okay?

292
00:17:47,310 --> 00:17:48,270
What are you going to lie to me about now?

293
00:17:48,290 --> 00:17:49,310
I’m not lying.

294
00:17:49,340 --> 00:17:50,550
I’m serious.

295
00:17:50,940 --> 00:17:54,570
Yotha and I grew up differently.

296
00:17:54,620 --> 00:17:56,510
Our parents divorced when we were kids.

297
00:17:56,540 --> 00:18:00,330
Yotha and our oldest brother Newton stayed with Dad.

298
00:18:00,350 --> 00:18:02,270
I moved in with Mom.

299
00:18:02,300 --> 00:18:04,470
Then, when I was in about grade 9,

300
00:18:04,510 --> 00:18:07,770
Mom remarried so I moved back in with them.

301
00:18:08,590 --> 00:18:10,720
Whoa, that’s intense.

302
00:18:11,000 --> 00:18:12,800
Try to understand him.

303
00:18:12,830 --> 00:18:15,150
He grew up in an all-men household.

304
00:18:15,170 --> 00:18:16,570
That’s why he’s cold.

305
00:18:16,610 --> 00:18:17,760
But despite how he seems,

306
00:18:17,770 --> 00:18:19,230
he’s a better person than you think.

307
00:18:19,910 --> 00:18:22,170
I’ll try to believe you, Fai.

308
00:18:22,190 --> 00:18:25,180
Once you really get to know him,
you’ll like him.

309
00:18:28,080 --> 00:18:31,890
Yotha is the one who doesn’t like me.

310
00:18:31,920 --> 00:18:33,560
That’s not true.

311
00:18:37,900 --> 00:18:38,960
You think so?

312
00:18:39,790 --> 00:18:40,350
Yeah.

313
00:18:40,390 --> 00:18:42,120
He really wants to sacrifice you.

314
00:18:43,570 --> 00:18:44,540
Stop joking.

315
00:18:46,280 --> 00:18:47,420
Stop talking in your sleep.

316
00:18:47,440 --> 00:18:48,780
Get him out of the room.

317
00:18:48,800 --> 00:18:49,960
I’m not leaving.

318
00:19:06,780 --> 00:19:07,670
Sorry.

319
00:19:09,370 --> 00:19:10,280
Why are you laughing?

320
00:19:10,990 --> 00:19:12,680
Your pajamas are cute.

321
00:19:16,190 --> 00:19:17,340
It’s a gift from my peer mentor.

322
00:19:19,020 --> 00:19:21,540
It’s cheerful just like Arm

323
00:19:21,950 --> 00:19:23,540
but it’s not your style at all.

324
00:19:25,340 --> 00:19:28,890
Did he force you to wear it?

325
00:19:30,390 --> 00:19:31,100
No.

326
00:19:31,890 --> 00:19:33,520
Don’t tell me you like this kind of thing.

327
00:19:33,550 --> 00:19:34,480
No.

328
00:19:34,500 --> 00:19:35,510
Then why are you wearing it?

329
00:19:35,530 --> 00:19:36,860
Because I won’t have to wash it often.

330
00:19:37,230 --> 00:19:37,900
Huh?

331
00:19:38,800 --> 00:19:40,860
Is the fabric anti-germ or something?

332
00:19:43,940 --> 00:19:44,600
What?

333
00:19:45,400 --> 00:19:46,420
Can you explain?

334
00:19:49,170 --> 00:19:49,480
Huh?

335
00:19:57,280 --> 00:19:58,630
Arm bought me a whole week’s worth of pajamas.

336
00:19:59,530 --> 00:20:00,400
Seriously?

337
00:20:03,720 --> 00:20:04,930
When will you stop laughing?

338
00:20:07,960 --> 00:20:10,130
Arm makes the best peer mentor for you.

339
00:20:13,300 --> 00:20:13,870
Why?

340
00:20:14,450 --> 00:20:15,080
What do you mean?

341
00:20:15,530 --> 00:20:17,200
He’s cheerful.

342
00:20:17,920 --> 00:20:20,510
He lights up your dark life.

343
00:20:20,810 --> 00:20:22,750
Look. It’s so yellow.

344
00:20:35,200 --> 00:20:36,290
You too.

345
00:20:39,630 --> 00:20:40,380
What?

346
00:20:41,380 --> 00:20:43,680
Are you saying I’m cheerful like Arm?

347
00:20:51,230 --> 00:20:51,880
No.

348
00:20:52,140 --> 00:20:53,380
Your face is yellow.

349
00:20:54,530 --> 00:20:55,850
What? You jerk!

350
00:20:56,110 --> 00:20:57,220
I’m going to sleep now.

351
00:20:57,610 --> 00:20:58,890
Stop talking so much.

352
00:21:09,820 --> 00:21:10,740
What are you looking at?

353
00:21:14,090 --> 00:21:15,630
Do you have a third eye?

354
00:21:17,720 --> 00:21:19,400
Just ask me what you want.

355
00:21:22,120 --> 00:21:23,880
Are you sure you can sleep with the lights on?

356
00:21:24,670 --> 00:21:28,140
If I say no, what are you going to do?

357
00:21:31,620 --> 00:21:33,030
I’m serious.

358
00:21:34,020 --> 00:21:37,360
I don’t want to trouble you like I did with Kong.

359
00:21:37,790 --> 00:21:39,230
He said he could sleep just fine,

360
00:21:39,260 --> 00:21:40,440
but in the end, he couldn’t.

361
00:21:41,760 --> 00:21:43,300
With or without the lights on,

362
00:21:43,320 --> 00:21:44,980
it’s dark when we close our eyes.

363
00:21:51,370 --> 00:21:52,250
That’s nice.

364
00:21:53,380 --> 00:21:56,080
But if I make you feel uncomfortable,

365
00:21:56,100 --> 00:21:57,720
you have to tell me right away, okay?

366
00:21:57,740 --> 00:21:58,810
Don’t lie.

367
00:21:59,410 --> 00:22:01,080
I never lie about my feelings.

368
00:22:02,590 --> 00:22:03,250
Really?

369
00:22:03,280 --> 00:22:04,040
Mm.

370
00:22:04,720 --> 00:22:07,170
If I don’t want to tell you something, I won’t.

371
00:22:07,210 --> 00:22:07,880
That’s it.

372
00:22:11,180 --> 00:22:12,640
How’s that different?

373
00:22:15,040 --> 00:22:16,830
Let’s continue this fight
tomorrow after we wake up.

374
00:22:16,850 --> 00:22:17,900
I’m tired.

375
00:22:17,930 --> 00:22:19,320
I’m going to sleep now.

376
00:22:20,680 --> 00:22:21,860
Come on.

377
00:22:24,180 --> 00:22:25,260
Fine, I’ll sleep too.

378
00:22:28,730 --> 00:22:30,170
Good night, Yotha.

379
00:22:30,710 --> 00:22:31,880
Don’t have nightmares.

380
00:22:42,810 --> 00:22:44,560
Morning, roommate.

381
00:22:45,230 --> 00:22:47,530
I got you some hot soybean milk.

382
00:22:48,510 --> 00:22:49,530
When did you buy it?

383
00:22:49,550 --> 00:22:52,320
I just went downstairs to eat
so I got it for you.

384
00:22:53,770 --> 00:22:55,870
I’m off to uni.

385
00:22:56,050 --> 00:22:57,090
I have a morning class.

386
00:22:57,110 --> 00:22:57,890
Mm.

387
00:23:00,410 --> 00:23:02,310
Do you know how to respond differently?

388
00:23:02,340 --> 00:23:04,410
You keep saying ‘Mm’.

389
00:23:04,420 --> 00:23:06,040
You’re so cold.

390
00:23:16,110 --> 00:23:16,590
Krub.

391
00:23:32,900 --> 00:23:33,210
Krub.

392
00:23:34,670 --> 00:23:35,050
Krub.

393
00:23:36,680 --> 00:23:37,120
Krub.

394
00:23:39,920 --> 00:23:40,510
Krub.

395
00:23:53,100 --> 00:23:53,870
Let’s go, dude.

396
00:23:54,240 --> 00:23:55,880
Whoa.

397
00:23:56,140 --> 00:23:58,410
I thought Yotha had killed you.

398
00:23:58,430 --> 00:23:59,340
Come on.

399
00:23:59,340 --> 00:24:01,160
You’ve only been waiting for a while.

400
00:24:01,510 --> 00:24:03,020
Don’t complain.

401
00:24:03,050 --> 00:24:04,040
It’s been half an hour already.

402
00:24:04,070 --> 00:24:05,340
I should’ve gone with Faifa.

403
00:24:05,790 --> 00:24:07,020
Are you sure?

404
00:24:07,040 --> 00:24:09,080
He would’ve been picking up all his friends,

405
00:24:09,110 --> 00:24:10,480
and you’d have been even later than waiting for me.

406
00:24:12,000 --> 00:24:12,720
That’s true.

407
00:24:13,050 --> 00:24:13,740
Let’s go.

408
00:24:13,760 --> 00:24:14,370
Let’s go.

409
00:24:27,300 --> 00:24:30,800
JUST PUT IT ON AND SLIDE IT UP.
HOPE YOU CAN DO IT.

410
00:25:05,930 --> 00:25:06,890
Yo.

411
00:25:07,710 --> 00:25:10,890
Gun, are you Yotha’s roommate now?

412
00:25:11,240 --> 00:25:11,800
Yeah.

413
00:25:11,950 --> 00:25:13,280
What were you thinking?

414
00:25:13,660 --> 00:25:14,400
Why not?

415
00:25:14,860 --> 00:25:16,260
Faifa used to live with him.

416
00:25:16,540 --> 00:25:18,080
That’s his brother.

417
00:25:18,100 --> 00:25:19,290
Of course, he wouldn’t hurt him.

418
00:25:19,310 --> 00:25:21,450
Yotha is not mean like you think.

419
00:25:24,520 --> 00:25:27,150
Despite how he seems,
he’s a better person than you think.

420
00:25:27,810 --> 00:25:30,000
I’ll try to believe you, Fai.

421
00:25:30,030 --> 00:25:32,970
Once you really get to know him,
you’ll like him.

422
00:25:37,240 --> 00:25:39,610
Once you guys get to know him like I do,

423
00:25:39,630 --> 00:25:40,890
you’ll like him.

424
00:25:44,110 --> 00:25:45,280
Are you cursed with black magic?

425
00:25:46,060 --> 00:25:48,750
You’ve only been sharing a room for one night
and you’re already defending him.

426
00:25:49,080 --> 00:25:50,120
I’m not.

427
00:25:50,540 --> 00:25:51,610
I’m just telling the truth.

428
00:25:51,640 --> 00:25:53,610
The truth, huh?

429
00:25:54,210 --> 00:25:56,310
Yotha might seem cold

430
00:25:56,330 --> 00:25:57,610
but he’s not a danger to anyone.

431
00:25:57,630 --> 00:25:58,320
Trust me.

432
00:25:59,340 --> 00:26:00,510
You’re being weird.

433
00:26:00,920 --> 00:26:01,420
What?

434
00:26:01,820 --> 00:26:03,160
Stop scolding me.

435
00:26:06,320 --> 00:26:07,110
Okay.

436
00:26:07,120 --> 00:26:07,920
You’re all here.

437
00:26:07,940 --> 00:26:09,450
Let me introduce myself.

438
00:26:09,480 --> 00:26:10,480
My name is Sam.

439
00:26:10,750 --> 00:26:12,060
I’m vice president of Year 2.

440
00:26:14,700 --> 00:26:16,310
That’s my peer mentor!

441
00:26:17,230 --> 00:26:18,820
I may look scary,

442
00:26:18,850 --> 00:26:21,120
but our freshmen-welcoming activities

443
00:26:21,150 --> 00:26:22,640
will be constructive, rest assured.

444
00:26:23,160 --> 00:26:23,900
Woo!

445
00:26:26,440 --> 00:26:27,370
Okay.

446
00:26:27,390 --> 00:26:29,470
I’ll have you draw lots

447
00:26:29,780 --> 00:26:32,000
and form groups based on the number you get.

448
00:26:32,030 --> 00:26:35,370
After that, each group will come up with a short drama.

449
00:26:35,400 --> 00:26:37,380
Oh, no.

450
00:26:37,400 --> 00:26:38,660
Not drama again.

451
00:26:38,700 --> 00:26:40,330
Listen first.

452
00:26:41,120 --> 00:26:44,460
Before you draw lots, I have something to announce.

453
00:26:44,480 --> 00:26:46,990
The campus star contest is coming up.

454
00:26:47,000 --> 00:26:50,750
Our criteria for the campus stars
aren’t based only on looks anymore.

455
00:26:50,780 --> 00:26:53,930
We’re now looking for representatives
who are talented, clever, and confident

456
00:26:53,950 --> 00:26:55,930
under the concept of “Perfect 10”.

457
00:27:08,990 --> 00:27:10,170
Which group should we join?

458
00:27:10,200 --> 00:27:11,360
No idea.

459
00:27:11,390 --> 00:27:13,490
Let’s just close our eyes and find it.

460
00:27:13,890 --> 00:27:14,690
You sure?

461
00:27:14,720 --> 00:27:15,450
Yeah.

462
00:27:18,120 --> 00:27:19,230
Hey, Faifa.

463
00:27:19,250 --> 00:27:19,610
Hmm?

464
00:27:19,640 --> 00:27:20,810
Do you have a group yet?

465
00:27:20,830 --> 00:27:22,720
Yes, I’m in Group 5.

466
00:27:22,760 --> 00:27:25,030
I'll go and sign up for the campus star contest.

467
00:27:25,030 --> 00:27:26,670
You’re joining the contest?

468
00:27:26,950 --> 00:27:28,030
My friends asked me to.

469
00:27:28,060 --> 00:27:28,560
I’ll be right back.

470
00:27:30,080 --> 00:27:32,310
If anyone should be
the Civil Engineering representative,

471
00:27:32,320 --> 00:27:33,900
it’s Yotha.

472
00:27:33,930 --> 00:27:35,230
It'll be a sibling war.

473
00:27:36,400 --> 00:27:39,930
I don’t think Yotha will agree to compete.

474
00:27:40,180 --> 00:27:42,310
Oh, you know him so well.

475
00:27:42,350 --> 00:27:43,880
You’re his close roommate.

476
00:27:44,720 --> 00:27:45,480
What?

477
00:27:45,510 --> 00:27:46,620
Stop teasing me.

478
00:27:47,440 --> 00:27:48,810
Stop smiling.

479
00:27:49,190 --> 00:27:51,700
Hey, where’s your roommate?

480
00:27:52,150 --> 00:27:53,480
My roommate?

481
00:27:53,520 --> 00:27:55,890
Just now, I saw him…

482
00:27:57,650 --> 00:27:58,530
Over there.

483
00:27:58,820 --> 00:28:00,240
Far away.

484
00:28:00,270 --> 00:28:03,570
But now he’s gone.

485
00:28:04,510 --> 00:28:06,000
The Civil Engineering major is looking for him.

486
00:28:06,030 --> 00:28:07,660
They want him to join the campus star contest.

487
00:28:07,690 --> 00:28:08,720
Oh.

488
00:28:10,120 --> 00:28:13,690
I’ll let him know when I see him.

489
00:28:17,200 --> 00:28:17,880
Ow!

490
00:28:18,480 --> 00:28:19,290
I need to pee.

491
00:28:20,080 --> 00:28:21,390
You’re squirming.

492
00:28:21,420 --> 00:28:22,770
I’m going to the restroom.

493
00:28:24,700 --> 00:28:25,590
Okay.

494
00:28:32,520 --> 00:28:33,600
Are you playing hide and seek?

495
00:28:34,800 --> 00:28:35,820
There! I got you!

496
00:28:37,180 --> 00:28:38,240
I’m not hiding from you.

497
00:28:40,890 --> 00:28:43,260
You can just tell your friends
you don’t want to compete.

498
00:28:43,280 --> 00:28:45,880
Are you going to keep running forever?

499
00:28:46,220 --> 00:28:47,880
I don’t like talking to people.

500
00:28:48,570 --> 00:28:49,560
Including me?

501
00:28:49,580 --> 00:28:50,510
I can go.

502
00:28:53,890 --> 00:28:54,590
Excluding you.

503
00:28:56,240 --> 00:28:57,060
That’s a relief.

504
00:28:58,030 --> 00:29:00,370
But how long are you going to stay here?

505
00:29:00,840 --> 00:29:02,490
Are you waiting until everyone leaves?

506
00:29:04,430 --> 00:29:04,890
No.

507
00:29:07,770 --> 00:29:08,670
So?

508
00:29:09,900 --> 00:29:11,390
I was only waiting for you to find me.

509
00:29:13,900 --> 00:29:14,900
Waiting for me?

510
00:29:14,900 --> 00:29:15,500
Mm.

511
00:29:17,570 --> 00:29:18,650
Why were you waiting for me?

512
00:29:19,140 --> 00:29:20,670
You looked like you were going to follow me.

513
00:29:21,600 --> 00:29:23,600
You can read my eyes?

514
00:29:24,160 --> 00:29:26,460
If I hadn’t followed you,

515
00:29:26,480 --> 00:29:28,460
would you have stayed in the restroom until morning?

516
00:29:32,820 --> 00:29:33,710
And you came.

517
00:29:36,750 --> 00:29:37,360
You’re right.

518
00:29:39,840 --> 00:29:40,650
Can we leave now?

519
00:29:41,350 --> 00:29:42,570
Do you have to stay for anything else?

520
00:29:44,220 --> 00:29:46,410
I don’t think so.

521
00:29:49,880 --> 00:29:50,910
But…

522
00:29:55,150 --> 00:29:56,750
I’m hungry.

523
00:29:58,780 --> 00:29:59,900
Annoying.

524
00:30:03,400 --> 00:30:04,850
But you’re going to eat with me, right?

525
00:30:12,850 --> 00:30:14,160
You love drinking milk?

526
00:30:15,770 --> 00:30:16,590
How do you know?

527
00:30:16,800 --> 00:30:18,590
You had some last night too.

528
00:30:19,880 --> 00:30:20,810
Are you finding faults with me?

529
00:30:21,600 --> 00:30:22,700
It’s called observing.

530
00:30:23,130 --> 00:30:23,900
We’re roommates.

531
00:30:23,920 --> 00:30:25,610
We should learn about each other

532
00:30:26,240 --> 00:30:27,850
so we can live happily together.

533
00:30:28,490 --> 00:30:29,420
Learn about each other?

534
00:30:30,140 --> 00:30:30,920
Yeah.

535
00:30:30,940 --> 00:30:33,880
What have you learned about me so far?

536
00:30:34,650 --> 00:30:36,100
Many things.

537
00:30:36,400 --> 00:30:37,490
You love milk.

538
00:30:38,060 --> 00:30:39,190
Plain-flavored, right?

539
00:30:39,950 --> 00:30:41,460
You don’t know how to tie neckties.

540
00:30:41,480 --> 00:30:42,510
You don’t make your bed.

541
00:30:42,780 --> 00:30:44,620
You love wearing animal-printed yellow pajamas.

542
00:30:44,640 --> 00:30:45,710
I don’t love them.

543
00:30:46,230 --> 00:30:47,370
Arm bought them for me.

544
00:30:47,390 --> 00:30:48,240
Yeah, yeah.

545
00:30:48,280 --> 00:30:49,000
It’s the same.

546
00:30:49,030 --> 00:30:51,370
You don’t talk a lot
but you scold harshly.

547
00:30:51,450 --> 00:30:52,280
You scolded me before.

548
00:30:54,470 --> 00:30:55,890
You’re hard to read.

549
00:30:56,410 --> 00:30:57,980
It’ll probably take me a bit more time.

550
00:30:58,850 --> 00:30:59,620
Really?

551
00:31:01,180 --> 00:31:03,010
One more important thing.

552
00:31:03,370 --> 00:31:04,730
You can sleep with the lights on.

553
00:31:05,320 --> 00:31:06,940
I really like that.

554
00:31:07,520 --> 00:31:08,110
Like?

555
00:31:08,400 --> 00:31:09,640
Yes, very much.

556
00:31:10,030 --> 00:31:13,380
Are you saying you like me?

557
00:31:23,600 --> 00:31:24,870
It’s not like that.

558
00:31:29,380 --> 00:31:30,350
What about you?

559
00:31:30,370 --> 00:31:31,880
What do you know about me?

560
00:31:32,690 --> 00:31:33,660
Do I need to?

561
00:31:34,750 --> 00:31:35,690
Wow.

562
00:31:37,660 --> 00:31:39,450
I love that answer.

563
00:31:40,240 --> 00:31:42,240
You really don’t lie to people.

564
00:32:03,110 --> 00:32:04,350
Are you going out again?

565
00:32:04,910 --> 00:32:05,420
Mm.

566
00:32:05,980 --> 00:32:08,870
Are you coming back late
or not at all?

567
00:32:09,470 --> 00:32:10,310
I don’t know yet.

568
00:32:10,800 --> 00:32:14,200
You come back after the dorm closes every night.

569
00:32:14,240 --> 00:32:15,550
Doesn’t security have a problem with that?

570
00:32:15,960 --> 00:32:17,880
I just need to sign in and write my reasons.

571
00:32:19,920 --> 00:32:21,440
What did you write?

572
00:32:24,780 --> 00:32:25,563
I went to eat congee.

573
00:32:33,390 --> 00:32:35,530
I hope you’re not going to do anything bad, Yotha.

574
00:32:50,330 --> 00:32:51,427
You’re back.

575
00:32:58,910 --> 00:32:59,907
Are you okay?

576
00:33:06,610 --> 00:33:07,883
Whoa, Yotha.

577
00:33:08,683 --> 00:33:09,889
What happened to you?

578
00:33:10,640 --> 00:33:11,427
Go to sleep.

579
00:33:17,080 --> 00:33:18,640
If you don’t want to tell me, it’s fine.

580
00:33:19,620 --> 00:33:21,384
But you need to get up
so I can dress your wounds.

581
00:33:33,784 --> 00:33:34,707
Stay still.

582
00:33:37,020 --> 00:33:37,883
It’s done.

583
00:33:38,670 --> 00:33:39,858
Any more wounds?

584
00:33:40,990 --> 00:33:42,141
Yes, but it’s fine.

585
00:33:42,160 --> 00:33:42,941
Where?

586
00:33:50,160 --> 00:33:50,966
Damn.

587
00:33:52,040 --> 00:33:53,846
Didn’t it hurt when you lied down?

588
00:34:00,590 --> 00:34:01,889
Your temperature is a bit high too.

589
00:34:01,926 --> 00:34:02,800
Your wounds must be inflamed.

590
00:34:02,818 --> 00:34:04,455
Does Chemical Engineering teach you medicine too?

591
00:34:05,138 --> 00:34:05,920
Not funny.

592
00:34:21,150 --> 00:34:22,116
Lie down.

593
00:34:24,400 --> 00:34:25,353
I’ll give you a sponge bath.

594
00:34:29,110 --> 00:34:29,692
Lie down.

595
00:34:42,100 --> 00:34:42,929
Give me your arms.

596
00:34:44,609 --> 00:34:45,870
How did you even sleep earlier?

597
00:34:53,650 --> 00:34:55,212
You don’t have to do this much.

598
00:34:56,664 --> 00:34:58,196
Wounds and fever can go away on their own.

599
00:35:00,650 --> 00:35:03,132
Your logic on life sucks.

600
00:35:03,580 --> 00:35:05,243
If everything could recover by itself,

601
00:35:05,273 --> 00:35:06,910
we wouldn’t need any doctors.

602
00:35:23,530 --> 00:35:24,160
Here.

603
00:35:24,356 --> 00:35:25,384
It’ll help with the inflammation.

604
00:35:25,990 --> 00:35:27,433
Take these and sleep so you can recover.

605
00:35:27,464 --> 00:35:28,166
Nuisance.

606
00:35:30,300 --> 00:35:32,486
I’m worried about you, not being a nuisance.

607
00:35:56,720 --> 00:35:58,449
Just take these and sleep.

608
00:35:59,292 --> 00:36:00,424
Hurry up.

609
00:36:00,449 --> 00:36:01,347
I’m sleepy.

610
00:36:03,240 --> 00:36:04,295
Meddler.

611
00:36:05,778 --> 00:36:07,770
Fine, call me whatever you want.

612
00:36:07,895 --> 00:36:09,015
Why are you staring?

613
00:36:09,046 --> 00:36:10,560
Just take these.

614
00:36:10,590 --> 00:36:11,224
Come on.

615
00:36:11,610 --> 00:36:12,621
So you can recover.

616
00:36:19,720 --> 00:36:20,449
Now sleep.

617
00:36:29,270 --> 00:36:30,375
Close your eyes.

618
00:36:34,250 --> 00:36:36,061
Hey, I told you to close your eyes.

619
00:36:36,086 --> 00:36:36,984
Why are your eyes open?

620
00:36:37,790 --> 00:36:38,824
I want to look at your face.

621
00:36:40,580 --> 00:36:42,289
Don’t look at my face.

622
00:36:42,307 --> 00:36:43,427
Sleep now.

623
00:36:43,446 --> 00:36:46,387
If you feel worse at night, wake me up.

624
00:36:46,406 --> 00:36:47,889
But don’t die.

625
00:36:48,369 --> 00:36:50,360
I’m even more scared of ghosts than the dark.

626
00:36:54,326 --> 00:36:54,812
Hey.

627
00:36:55,667 --> 00:36:56,984
If I get worse,

628
00:36:57,720 --> 00:36:59,101
how will I have the energy to call you?

629
00:36:59,680 --> 00:37:01,427
What are you doing?

630
00:37:01,446 --> 00:37:02,455
What’s wrong with you?

631
00:37:02,900 --> 00:37:03,876
Does it hurt?

632
00:37:05,360 --> 00:37:06,043
Hey!

633
00:37:06,370 --> 00:37:07,316
Stay like this.

634
00:37:08,450 --> 00:37:09,618
If anything happens to me,

635
00:37:10,180 --> 00:37:11,600
you’ll be the first to know.

636

00:37:36,658 --> 00:37:38,030
but I won’t let you go anywhere.

642
00:37:39,390 --> 00:37:40,516

Yotha is sick?

648
00:38:05,400 --> 00:38:06,861
More like he’s faking it.

649
00:38:06,886 --> 00:38:08,110
He’s really sick.

650
00:38:08,443 --> 00:38:11,470
When he came back last night,
he had bruises on his mouth and ab.

651
00:38:13,040 --> 00:38:17,132
Actually, I’ve heard things
about Yotha from Arc’s friends.

652
00:38:17,420 --> 00:38:19,200
What about him?

653
00:38:20,950 --> 00:38:22,221
Just tell him, Arm.

654
00:38:22,258 --> 00:38:23,483
Gun can hear it.

655
00:38:26,250 --> 00:38:28,363
I don’t know much

656
00:38:28,400 --> 00:38:32,116
but people on the outside
aren’t saying nice things about Yotha.

657
00:38:32,123 --> 00:38:33,433
And then there are his fights.

658
00:38:34,250 --> 00:38:35,895
Besides his friends at university,

659
00:38:35,938 --> 00:38:39,901
not many people like him.

660
00:38:40,640 --> 00:38:43,433
When the outsiders found out
he’s in my and Arc’s group,

661
00:38:43,476 --> 00:38:45,430
they told Arc to warn him.

662
00:38:46,110 --> 00:38:47,846
But I haven’t told him anything.

663
00:38:47,870 --> 00:38:50,338
I don’t feel comfortable enough yet.

664
00:38:50,363 --> 00:38:51,587
Not just you, Arm.

665
00:38:51,612 --> 00:38:54,363
I’m his blood brother
but I don’t dare talk to him about it either.

666
00:38:55,070 --> 00:38:58,867
That said, though, Yotha is good to his close circle.

667
00:38:59,058 --> 00:39:00,289
He can be trusted.

668
00:39:00,670 --> 00:39:02,560
I don’t want you to hate him or be scared of him.

669
00:39:02,596 --> 00:39:03,680
I don’t.

670
00:39:04,130 --> 00:39:06,055
Even though I’m not close with him,

671
00:39:06,067 --> 00:39:07,600
I know he’s a good guy.

672
00:39:08,700 --> 00:39:09,649
Hey, Ears.

673
00:39:10,090 --> 00:39:11,833
You’ve been spending time with him lately.

674
00:39:11,864 --> 00:39:13,830
You should find an opportunity to talk to him.

675
00:39:13,864 --> 00:39:15,830
Maybe he’ll open up more to you.

676
00:39:18,780 --> 00:39:19,427
Okay.

677
00:39:20,680 --> 00:39:21,809
Alright, we’re done.

678
00:39:21,852 --> 00:39:23,800
I’ll let you know when your outfit is ready.

679
00:39:23,827 --> 00:39:26,203
Thanks a lot for competing in the campus star contest.

680
00:39:26,227 --> 00:39:27,409
No problem.

681
00:39:36,676 --> 00:39:37,249
Hey.

682
00:39:37,267 --> 00:39:38,178
Are you feeling better?

683
00:39:39,640 --> 00:39:40,313
Mm.

684
00:39:45,610 --> 00:39:46,713
Whoa.

685
00:39:46,750 --> 00:39:48,283
Your bruises look even worse.

686
00:39:48,540 --> 00:39:50,067
When did you eat and take your medicine?

687
00:39:51,009 --> 00:39:52,104
I’m not sure.

688
00:39:52,800 --> 00:39:54,732
I’ll give you a sponge bath.

689
00:39:55,030 --> 00:39:56,356
You still have a little fever.

690
00:39:56,830 --> 00:39:57,704
It’s okay.

691
00:39:58,330 --> 00:39:59,883
I just took a shower.

692
00:39:59,913 --> 00:40:01,009
You took a shower?

693
00:40:01,033 --> 00:40:01,975
Are you crazy?

694
00:40:02,006 --> 00:40:03,107
You have a fever.

695
00:40:03,126 --> 00:40:04,510
You live a weird life.

696
00:40:04,535 --> 00:40:05,870
How did you grow up?

697
00:40:16,000 --> 00:40:18,652
Hey, I’m sorry.

698
00:40:19,690 --> 00:40:21,101
I grew up this way.

699
00:40:22,360 --> 00:40:23,600
I grew up by myself.

700
00:40:24,683 --> 00:40:25,889
I didn’t die, did I?

701
00:40:28,440 --> 00:40:30,793
Yotha, why did you say that?

702
00:40:33,090 --> 00:40:34,190
No more of that.

703
00:40:34,221 --> 00:40:35,686
I don’t like anything stressful.

704
00:40:37,100 --> 00:40:38,806
Let’s eat.

705
00:40:39,292 --> 00:40:40,049
Congee.

706
00:40:41,100 --> 00:40:42,073
It’s hot.

707
00:40:46,760 --> 00:40:48,443
Not funny?

708
00:40:50,440 --> 00:40:51,581
But you’re secretly smiling

709
00:40:52,990 --> 00:40:53,950
You’re smiling.

710
00:40:54,920 --> 00:40:55,464
Here

711
00:40:56,530 --> 00:41:00,689
Eat and take your medicine
so you’ll recover.

712
00:41:01,335 --> 00:41:02,541
I told you that you don’t have to do this.

713
00:41:02,978 --> 00:41:04,540
I can recover on my own.

714
00:41:04,572 --> 00:41:06,086
But you have me now.

715
00:41:11,218 --> 00:41:12,061
What’s the point of having you?

716
00:41:15,310 --> 00:41:19,280
You have me, so you’ll recover faster.

717
00:41:19,920 --> 00:41:20,910
Not necessary.

718
00:41:23,230 --> 00:41:24,276
I don’t want to argue with you.

719
00:41:24,289 --> 00:41:24,923
Just eat.

720
00:41:24,941 --> 00:41:25,723
Finish it.

721
00:41:25,760 --> 00:41:26,406
Eat up.

722
00:41:26,683 --> 00:41:27,261
Just eat.

723
00:41:31,530 --> 00:41:32,246
Here.

724
00:41:33,690 --> 00:41:37,889
These are the sheets for general classes
and these are for Civil Engineering.

725
00:41:38,080 --> 00:41:39,249
I got them for you.

726
00:41:53,540 --> 00:41:54,467
Thank you.

727
00:41:55,980 --> 00:41:56,695
What?

728
00:41:58,290 --> 00:42:01,366
You should thank me.

729
00:42:06,190 --> 00:42:07,138
Thank

730
00:42:07,150 --> 00:42:08,067
you,

731
00:42:08,080 --> 00:42:08,701
sir.

732
00:42:09,378 --> 00:42:10,141
Great.

733
00:42:12,160 --> 00:42:15,532
I’ll give you a recap of the activities today.

734
00:42:16,480 --> 00:42:17,243
There’s no need.

735
00:42:17,833 --> 00:42:18,947
I’m not joining the activities.

736
00:42:19,643 --> 00:42:21,316
Think of this as small talk while we eat.

737
00:42:21,347 --> 00:42:22,455
I love eating in silence.

738
00:42:22,492 --> 00:42:23,889
I don’t.

739
00:42:25,160 --> 00:42:29,913
Today, each group started sharing ideas
for their drama.

740
00:42:29,944 --> 00:42:33,716
They then gave us homework
to propose something for the topic,

741
00:42:33,890 --> 00:42:36,812
“When you think of Engineering,
what’s the first thing that comes to mind?”

742
00:42:37,100 --> 00:42:38,627
But I can’t think of anything yet.

743
00:42:38,940 --> 00:42:42,098
If we talk about Engineering, it’s the faculty, right?

744
00:42:42,123 --> 00:42:43,120
What else could it be?

745
00:42:43,710 --> 00:42:45,083
Do you have any ideas, Yotha?

746
00:42:45,340 --> 00:42:46,110
You.

747
00:42:52,650 --> 00:42:53,304
Me?

748
00:42:53,740 --> 00:42:57,280
You’re the number one
troublemaker in Engineering.

749
00:43:07,650 --> 00:43:10,246
Sleeping right after eating
will give you acid reflux, just you wait.

750
00:43:10,270 --> 00:43:11,316
Why don’t you go into medicine instead?

751
00:43:13,100 --> 00:43:14,252
You’re good at being sarcastic.

752
00:43:37,950 --> 00:43:39,310
Why are you staring at me?

753
00:43:39,341 --> 00:43:41,310
Aren’t you going out tonight?

754
00:43:42,500 --> 00:43:43,483
Can I ask you something?

755
00:43:44,490 --> 00:43:46,818
Where do you usually go?

756
00:43:47,240 --> 00:43:48,203
Why do you want to know?

757
00:43:49,800 --> 00:43:53,120
You’re not going out to do anything bad, are you?

758
00:43:55,030 --> 00:43:55,907
Fine.

759
00:43:56,280 --> 00:43:57,526
I’ll stop bothering you.

760
00:44:04,130 --> 00:44:04,867
Yotha.

761
00:44:04,880 --> 00:44:06,209
What now?

762
00:44:06,730 --> 00:44:07,938
Let’s play a game.

763
00:44:07,969 --> 00:44:08,498
No.

764
00:44:09,770 --> 00:44:10,750
Come on.

765
00:44:10,793 --> 00:44:12,209
It’s just a simple Q&A game.

766
00:44:12,660 --> 00:44:14,123
I want to get to know you better.

767
00:44:14,996 --> 00:44:16,990
My life is not interesting.

768
00:44:17,980 --> 00:44:18,886
Hmm.

769
00:44:19,630 --> 00:44:21,015
When you see me,

770
00:44:21,384 --> 00:44:23,010
what’s the first thing you think of?

771
00:44:23,480 --> 00:44:24,640
A dog.

772
00:44:26,030 --> 00:44:27,218
Did Fai tell you about that?

773
00:44:27,249 --> 00:44:28,566
You really look like a dog.

774
00:44:28,596 --> 00:44:29,643
Damn.

775
00:44:30,570 --> 00:44:31,901
Do I really look like a dog?

776
00:44:34,160 --> 00:44:34,880
Oeagle.

777
00:44:34,910 --> 00:44:36,332
Beagle, you jerk.

778
00:44:38,670 --> 00:44:40,289
Let’s change the question.

779
00:44:40,880 --> 00:44:43,193
When it comes to love,

780
00:44:43,236 --> 00:44:44,633
what’s the first thing you think of?

781
00:44:45,120 --> 00:44:45,778
Skip.

782
00:44:46,190 --> 00:44:47,501
You can’t skip it.

783
00:44:47,741 --> 00:44:49,366
I don’t think of shit.

784
00:44:51,360 --> 00:44:52,726
But for me,

785
00:44:52,756 --> 00:44:55,550
the first thing I think of is
my mom.

786
00:44:56,450 --> 00:44:57,747
Childish thought.

787
00:44:58,730 --> 00:44:59,747
Then…

788
00:44:59,772 --> 00:45:00,843
I’ll sleep now.

789
00:45:01,270 --> 00:45:02,123
Fine.

790
00:45:02,950 --> 00:45:04,172
Good night, Yotha.

791
00:45:04,209 --> 00:45:04,793
Mm.

792
00:45:04,830 --> 00:45:05,889
Don’t have nightmares.

793
00:45:09,240 --> 00:45:10,670
Can I ask you one more thing?

794
00:45:11,820 --> 00:45:15,766
Why do you always say
“Don’t have nightmares”?

795
00:45:16,160 --> 00:45:17,526
Why not “Good night”?

796
00:45:17,901 --> 00:45:20,492
Because when you wake up
and realize it’s just a dream,

797
00:45:21,000 --> 00:45:22,067
you’ll feel bad.

798
00:45:25,710 --> 00:45:27,033
If it’s a bad dream

799
00:45:27,810 --> 00:45:29,901
and you wake up to realize it’s not real,

800
00:45:29,926 --> 00:45:31,193
you’ll feel better.

801
00:45:32,760 --> 00:45:33,864
If I had a choice,

802
00:45:34,710 --> 00:45:38,387
I’d prefer to sleep deeply and not dream at all.

803
00:45:45,144 --> 00:45:47,446
Alright then.

804
00:45:48,050 --> 00:45:49,273
I hope you sleep deeply tonight.

805
00:45:51,270 --> 00:45:51,895
You too.

806
00:46:17,080 --> 00:46:17,920
You startled me.

807
00:46:18,560 --> 00:46:19,852
Why are you sitting here staring at me?

808
00:46:19,883 --> 00:46:20,849
You woke up late.

809
00:46:22,960 --> 00:46:24,276
My class is in the afternoon.

810
00:46:27,280 --> 00:46:27,920
Can you tie it for me?

811
00:46:31,163 --> 00:46:33,220
Give me 10 seconds to brush my teeth.

812
00:46:50,140 --> 00:46:50,978
Watch

813
00:46:52,120 --> 00:46:53,600
and learn how to tie it yourself.

814
00:47:00,810 --> 00:47:02,289
Bring it in front like this

815
00:47:03,020 --> 00:47:04,196
and wrap it around the back.

816
00:47:05,372 --> 00:47:08,116
Then put the long end in front.

817
00:47:09,212 --> 00:47:10,658
Then do this.

818
00:47:11,800 --> 00:47:12,258
Put it up.

819
00:47:12,276 --> 00:47:13,040
Put it up.

820
00:47:28,600 --> 00:47:29,606
Are you listening?

821
00:47:33,600 --> 00:47:34,658
All done.

822
00:47:36,850 --> 00:47:38,578
See? It’s not hard, is it?

823
00:47:38,740 --> 00:47:39,280
No.

824
00:47:40,680 --> 00:47:41,446
See?

825
00:47:41,803 --> 00:47:43,440
It’s not hard and you can do it yourself.

826
00:47:43,464 --> 00:47:44,369
I didn’t watch.

827
00:47:51,970 --> 00:47:53,901
What’s wrong with you, Yotha?

828
00:47:54,940 --> 00:47:56,350
Why won’t you listen when I teach you?

829
00:48:04,043 --> 00:48:04,732
Gun.

830
00:48:05,580 --> 00:48:07,070
Hey, Sam.

831
00:48:07,101 --> 00:48:08,147
What are you doing here?

832
00:48:08,166 --> 00:48:09,624
I came to see you.

833
00:48:09,655 --> 00:48:10,689
Where are you going?

834
00:48:10,720 --> 00:48:11,889
Drama rehearsal?

835
00:48:11,926 --> 00:48:12,763
Yes.

836
00:48:14,230 --> 00:48:15,489
I brought you a treat.

837
00:48:15,501 --> 00:48:16,683
Thank you.

838
00:48:17,220 --> 00:48:18,787
My group hasn’t finished the script yet.

839
00:48:18,824 --> 00:48:19,766
We’re still practicing.

840
00:48:19,796 --> 00:48:20,510
Really?

841
00:48:20,535 --> 00:48:21,723
What role are you playing?

842
00:48:21,760 --> 00:48:22,566
Guess.

843
00:48:23,450 --> 00:48:24,523
I don’t think

844
00:48:25,280 --> 00:48:26,510
you can pull off a male lead.

845
00:48:28,290 --> 00:48:29,366
Are you playing a villager?

846
00:48:29,520 --> 00:48:30,098
Wrong.

847
00:48:30,129 --> 00:48:31,181
I’ll let you guess again.

848
00:48:31,200 --> 00:48:32,246
I don’t know.

849
00:48:32,870 --> 00:48:33,716
A dog?

850
00:48:34,380 --> 00:48:35,323
What?

851
00:48:35,360 --> 00:48:36,492
How did you know?

852
00:48:36,516 --> 00:48:38,036
You’re really playing a dog?

853
00:48:39,290 --> 00:48:40,363
Yes.

854
00:48:40,400 --> 00:48:41,372
I’m playing a celebrity dog.

855
00:48:41,396 --> 00:48:42,603
Do you have lines to say?

856
00:48:42,633 --> 00:48:43,790
I’m playing a dog.

857
00:48:43,821 --> 00:48:44,898
How can I have lines?

858
00:48:45,620 --> 00:48:49,076
On show day,
I’ll come and cheer for you.

859
00:48:49,107 --> 00:48:49,858
Okay.

860
00:48:49,876 --> 00:48:50,972
I have to go.

861
00:48:51,260 --> 00:48:53,150
Don’t you have to watch the rehearsals?

862
00:48:53,193 --> 00:48:54,781
I thought you were the vice president.

863
00:48:55,120 --> 00:48:57,120
I was on my way to give you a gift

864
00:48:57,150 --> 00:48:59,120
but I already ran into you here.

865
00:48:59,150 --> 00:49:02,104
More importantly, I’m the vice president.

866
00:49:02,135 --> 00:49:04,100
I'll leave the work to the president.

867
00:49:04,135 --> 00:49:07,723
Being vice president means
I'm a backup for the president.

868
00:49:07,741 --> 00:49:09,720
So, I’m leaving.

869
00:49:17,290 --> 00:49:18,763
I’m so tired.

870
00:49:20,180 --> 00:49:21,593
What do you mean, tired?

871
00:49:21,618 --> 00:49:22,295
You were just sitting there.

872
00:49:22,313 --> 00:49:23,280
You didn’t even have to bark.

873
00:49:23,316 --> 00:49:26,332
Unlike us, we had to memorize my script
and carry the props.

874
00:49:26,680 --> 00:49:28,775
I sprained my shoulder.

875
00:49:28,818 --> 00:49:29,507
Yeah.

876
00:49:29,532 --> 00:49:33,747
I wish I looked like a dog
so I can get an easy role like yours.

877
00:49:34,160 --> 00:49:34,812
Look like a dog?

878
00:49:34,855 --> 00:49:36,295
Are you bullying me or what?

879
00:49:36,338 --> 00:49:37,612
What kind of dog?

880
00:49:37,630 --> 00:49:38,996
Be specific.

881
00:49:39,015 --> 00:49:39,673
Yeah.

882
00:49:39,710 --> 00:49:41,901
You’re like a shedding chihuahua.

883
00:49:42,480 --> 00:49:44,000
A shedding chihuahua.

884
00:49:44,030 --> 00:49:45,409
Not just a chihuahua,
but your fur is falling out too.

885
00:49:45,433 --> 00:49:46,781
Seriously?

886
00:49:46,780 --> 00:49:47,907
When you see me,

887
00:49:48,104 --> 00:49:49,900
- Hey, why are you smiling?
- what’s the first thing you think of?

888
00:49:50,550 --> 00:49:51,310
A dog.

889
00:49:52,040 --> 00:49:53,298
Do I really look like a dog?

890
00:49:53,563 --> 00:49:54,332
Oeagle.

891
00:49:54,486 --> 00:49:56,043
Beagle, you jerk.

892
00:50:00,440 --> 00:50:00,953
Gun.

893
00:50:00,990 --> 00:50:01,600
Gun!

894
00:50:01,643 --> 00:50:02,313
Gun!

895
00:50:02,350 --> 00:50:02,861
Hmm?

896
00:50:03,290 --> 00:50:05,710
He just called you a shedding chihuahua.

897
00:50:05,741 --> 00:50:06,516
Aren’t you going to scold him?

898
00:50:06,572 --> 00:50:07,944
Chihuahua, my ass.

899
00:50:08,380 --> 00:50:09,563
I’m a beagle.

900
00:50:09,593 --> 00:50:10,720
Whoa, you’re a beagle?

901
00:50:10,756 --> 00:50:11,796
Whoa.

902
00:50:11,833 --> 00:50:12,652
If you’re slow, find your own way home.

903
00:50:12,707 --> 00:50:14,147
Hey, wait up!

904
00:50:17,580 --> 00:50:19,298
Arc, do you want to eat Somtam again?

905
00:50:19,329 --> 00:50:20,338
I’ll order it for you.

906
00:50:20,369 --> 00:50:22,867
Yeah, just order whatever you want.

907
00:50:23,400 --> 00:50:25,384
You’re the best boyfriend.

908
00:50:25,790 --> 00:50:26,892
You always indulge me.

909
00:50:27,610 --> 00:50:28,867
Same restaurant, right?

910
00:50:30,110 --> 00:50:30,824
Yeah.

911
00:50:35,100 --> 00:50:35,741
Arm.

912
00:50:36,984 --> 00:50:37,716
Hmm?

913
00:50:37,784 --> 00:50:39,027
Come and sit here.

914
00:50:50,010 --> 00:50:51,513
Is something going on, Arc?

915
00:50:55,270 --> 00:50:57,015
Let me hug you tightly before I tell you.

916
00:50:59,600 --> 00:51:00,720
You’re already hugging me.

917
00:51:01,310 --> 00:51:02,393
What is it?

918
00:51:13,200 --> 00:51:14,541
I got an internship.

919
00:51:16,440 --> 00:51:17,366
Really?

920
00:51:17,920 --> 00:51:21,544
So that means we won’t get to go
to uni together in the mornings anymore.

921
00:51:22,560 --> 00:51:25,083
Can you take me home to get my car this Saturday?

922
00:51:26,300 --> 00:51:27,046
There’s no need.

923
00:51:27,520 --> 00:51:28,664
You can use my car.

924
00:51:30,660 --> 00:51:31,593
Why?

925
00:51:32,221 --> 00:51:34,220
Is the company next to the BTS?

926
00:51:34,570 --> 00:51:35,446
That’s good.

927
00:51:35,464 --> 00:51:36,953
You won’t have to be stuck in the morning traffic.

928
00:51:39,530 --> 00:51:42,935
My company provides accommodation.

929
00:51:46,633 --> 00:51:47,686
In that case,

930
00:51:49,290 --> 00:51:50,516
can I live there with you?

931
00:51:51,020 --> 00:51:53,704
I’ll have to move to Rayong for 3 months.

932
00:51:53,735 --> 00:51:54,818
Whoa.

933
00:51:55,810 --> 00:51:57,544
You made it sound like you were going abroad.

934
00:51:57,556 --> 00:51:58,892
It’s just Rayong.

935
00:51:58,910 --> 00:52:00,344
It’s so close.

936
00:52:00,680 --> 00:52:01,661
Are you okay with this?

937
00:52:01,686 --> 00:52:03,520
Why wouldn’t I be?

938
00:52:03,550 --> 00:52:06,689
Besides, we’re still
several months away from the second semester.

939
00:52:06,713 --> 00:52:08,141
Why are you telling me this already?

940
00:52:08,443 --> 00:52:09,876
Because if you weren’t okay with this,

941
00:52:10,966 --> 00:52:12,960
I’d apply to intern somewhere else.

942
00:52:13,740 --> 00:52:14,738
Listen, Arc.

943
00:52:15,150 --> 00:52:16,344
I’m a grownup

944
00:52:16,375 --> 00:52:18,049
and I’m very reasonable.

945
00:52:18,540 --> 00:52:20,116
It’s just Rayong.

946
00:52:20,141 --> 00:52:20,880
It’s totally fine.

947
00:52:32,540 --> 00:52:34,603
Let the feeling of missing do its magic.

948
00:52:34,966 --> 00:52:36,960
If you’re with me every day,

949
00:52:36,990 --> 00:52:39,058
I’m scared you’ll get bored of me.

950
00:52:39,600 --> 00:52:40,584
Oh, Arm.

951
00:52:41,320 --> 00:52:43,113
You mean you’re scared I’ll stop breathing

952
00:52:43,138 --> 00:52:45,110
if I don’t get to hug you while sleeping every night.

953
00:52:55,110 --> 00:52:55,895
That feels great.

954
00:52:58,455 --> 00:52:59,110
So,

955
00:53:00,620 --> 00:53:01,526
here we go!

956
00:53:01,975 --> 00:53:04,529
♪ If I fall head over heels for you ♪

957
00:53:04,553 --> 00:53:07,366
♪ Then I can point the finger at who? ♪

958
00:53:09,180 --> 00:53:10,898
Wow.

959
00:53:11,760 --> 00:53:14,381
This room is much cleaner
than the one you were sharing with me.

960
00:53:14,424 --> 00:53:15,181
Of course.

961
00:53:15,530 --> 00:53:16,523
I’m still the same.

962
00:53:16,547 --> 00:53:18,104
You’re the messy one.

963
00:53:22,100 --> 00:53:23,876
Do you have any problems
sharing a room with him?

964
00:53:24,470 --> 00:53:25,298
No.

965
00:53:25,680 --> 00:53:26,953
Yotha can sleep deeply.

966
00:53:26,978 --> 00:53:28,553
I’ve been watching him for a few nights.

967
00:53:28,980 --> 00:53:31,489
You watch him every night?

968
00:53:33,770 --> 00:53:34,535
Of course.

969
00:53:34,566 --> 00:53:36,910
I don't want to make him uncomfortable
like I did you.

970
00:53:37,880 --> 00:53:40,504
I just don’t want to cause trouble for anyone.

971
00:53:40,633 --> 00:53:41,323
That’s all.

972
00:53:41,600 --> 00:53:42,344
It’s nothing more.

973
00:53:42,369 --> 00:53:43,895
I haven’t said anything.

974
00:53:43,913 --> 00:53:44,812
Why are you being defensive?

975
00:53:45,880 --> 00:53:47,230
I was just explaining.

976
00:53:47,593 --> 00:53:48,990
Oh.

977
00:53:49,890 --> 00:53:53,255
Don’t tell me
you fell for his charms like others did.

978
00:53:55,267 --> 00:53:56,252
What do you mean I fell for his charms?

979
00:53:57,396 --> 00:53:58,250
No way.

980
00:54:00,810 --> 00:54:04,307
Yotha and Faifa
are so popular at the uni right now.

981
00:54:04,916 --> 00:54:06,910
Faifa, I can understand,

982
00:54:07,190 --> 00:54:08,344
but Yotha?

983
00:54:08,910 --> 00:54:11,913
He’s mysterious and scary.

984
00:54:12,910 --> 00:54:14,689
Why do so many people like him?

985
00:54:14,695 --> 00:54:15,846
Many people like him?

986
00:54:15,870 --> 00:54:16,683
Yeah.

987
00:54:17,640 --> 00:54:21,009
Wait, why do you want to know?

988
00:54:22,310 --> 00:54:24,036
What? You idiot.

989
00:54:24,073 --> 00:54:26,147
You brought it up yourself.

990
00:54:26,600 --> 00:54:28,178
I’m just nosy.

991
00:54:28,221 --> 00:54:29,101
Many people like him.

992
00:54:29,530 --> 00:54:31,218
He has fans from other faculties too.

993
00:54:31,249 --> 00:54:35,846
But I heard that he doesn’t hang out with
anyone at the university.

994
00:54:36,280 --> 00:54:37,409
If you want to talk to him,

995
00:54:38,196 --> 00:54:39,526
the only way is to go to the bar.

996
00:54:42,390 --> 00:54:44,073
Your roommate is here.

997
00:54:44,092 --> 00:54:45,636
I should go.

998
00:54:46,460 --> 00:54:47,304
Bye.

999
00:54:50,590 --> 00:54:51,138
Hi.

1000
00:54:53,320 --> 00:54:54,123
Hey.

1001
00:54:54,756 --> 00:54:55,710
Did you have many classes today?

1002
00:54:55,741 --> 00:54:56,603
You’re back late.

1003
00:54:58,060 --> 00:54:58,713
Mm.

1004
00:55:03,144 --> 00:55:05,140
Are you going out tonight?

1005
00:55:06,240 --> 00:55:07,470
I’m waiting for my wounds to heal first.

1006
00:55:08,650 --> 00:55:10,135
Why?

1007
00:55:10,990 --> 00:55:12,621
Is it because
you don’t want to look bad when you see the girls?

1008
00:55:17,341 --> 00:55:19,340
How do you know who I’m going to see?

1009
00:55:20,040 --> 00:55:22,338
I just guessed randomly.

1010
00:55:22,381 --> 00:55:24,043
You never told me anything.

1011
00:55:24,080 --> 00:55:25,107
I told you

1012
00:55:25,840 --> 00:55:27,840
that if I don’t want anyone to know about something,

1013
00:55:28,440 --> 00:55:29,587
I won’t talk about it.

1014
00:55:29,612 --> 00:55:31,058
So don’t try.

1015
00:55:31,600 --> 00:55:33,027
Am I that wrong?

1016
00:55:33,846 --> 00:55:34,516
Sorry.

1017
00:55:48,730 --> 00:55:49,458
This is for you.

1018
00:55:50,990 --> 00:55:51,600
What is it?

1019
00:55:52,640 --> 00:55:53,440
A snack.

1020
00:55:57,320 --> 00:55:58,141
You bought it.

1021
00:55:58,172 --> 00:55:59,255
Keep it for yourself.

1022
00:56:00,140 --> 00:56:01,316
Arm gave it to me.

1023
00:56:02,490 --> 00:56:03,883
Arm gave it to you.

1024
00:56:03,913 --> 00:56:05,113
Why are you giving it to me?

1025
00:56:06,240 --> 00:56:07,415
I don’t like snacks.

1026
00:56:08,130 --> 00:56:09,433
Thanks, I guess.

1027
00:56:10,000 --> 00:56:11,169
Just leave it here.

1028
00:56:11,981 --> 00:56:12,713
I won’t eat it now.

1029
00:56:12,738 --> 00:56:13,692
I already brushed my teeth.

1030
00:56:15,470 --> 00:56:16,381
Sorry

1031
00:56:17,880 --> 00:56:19,230
for saying bad things to you.

1032
00:56:19,820 --> 00:56:20,873
I didn’t mean it.

1033
00:56:23,050 --> 00:56:23,901
What did you say?

1034
00:56:24,670 --> 00:56:25,864
Do you have bad ears or what?

1035
00:56:27,180 --> 00:56:28,430
Did you just apologize to me?

1036
00:56:30,540 --> 00:56:31,624
Let’s play a game.

1037
00:56:33,000 --> 00:56:33,901
What game?

1038
00:56:33,932 --> 00:56:35,900
You get one question.

1039
00:56:36,250 --> 00:56:37,698
You can ask me anything.

1040
00:56:38,040 --> 00:56:39,070
Are you dating anyone?

1041
00:56:44,150 --> 00:56:45,895
You don’t have to answer.

1042
00:56:46,135 --> 00:56:47,649
I just asked randomly.

1043
00:56:48,220 --> 00:56:49,513
I didn’t know what to ask you.

1044
00:56:49,544 --> 00:56:52,209
Why did you ask me that question?

1045
00:56:52,326 --> 00:56:53,520
I’m just curious.

1046
00:56:54,140 --> 00:56:56,227
I see you come back late at night.

1047
00:56:56,258 --> 00:56:58,220
I thought maybe you were with your partner.

1048
00:56:59,020 --> 00:56:59,858
No.

1049
00:57:15,920 --> 00:57:16,633
I’m

1050
00:57:17,560 --> 00:57:18,332
not

1051
00:57:20,380 --> 00:57:22,566
seeing anyone.

1052
00:57:27,803 --> 00:57:28,873
Alright.

1053
00:57:30,209 --> 00:57:31,870
Why did you move your face close to mine?

1054
00:57:34,220 --> 00:57:36,916
Can I ask you another question?

1055
00:57:36,941 --> 00:57:38,393
Your quota’s up for today.

1056
00:57:38,424 --> 00:57:39,126
What?

1057
00:57:40,130 --> 00:57:40,941
Come on.

1058
00:57:42,110 --> 00:57:43,858
Don’t you want to ask me anything in return?

1059
00:57:44,720 --> 00:57:46,240
Don’t you want to get to know me better?

1060
00:57:56,092 --> 00:57:56,984
What’s wrong?

1061
00:57:58,980 --> 00:57:59,956
I know everything.

1062
00:57:59,981 --> 00:58:01,513
How much longer are you going to hide it from me?

1063
00:58:01,544 --> 00:58:02,916
Darling, what happened?

1064
00:58:02,935 --> 00:58:05,901
Arm told me everything
about your internship.

1065
00:58:06,580 --> 00:58:08,393
I don’t think it’s that important.

1066
00:58:08,424 --> 00:58:09,686
Distance

1067
00:58:09,710 --> 00:58:11,409
is the main reason

1068
00:58:11,440 --> 00:58:12,720
people break up.

1069
00:58:12,763 --> 00:58:14,043
I don’t want to break up with you.

1070
00:58:14,067 --> 00:58:15,058
I don’t.

1071
00:58:18,730 --> 00:58:20,566
My internship is only in Sathorn.

1072
00:58:23,809 --> 00:58:24,320
Yeah.

1073
00:58:24,870 --> 00:58:25,464
Oh?

1074
00:58:25,460 --> 00:58:29,046
But Arm told me Arc is interning in Rayong.

1075
00:58:29,390 --> 00:58:33,310
Yes, but I’m interning at my dad’s friend’s company.

1076
00:58:33,335 --> 00:58:34,800
It’s in Sathorn.

1077
00:58:36,923 --> 00:58:39,630
Why didn't you tell me earlier?

1078
00:58:39,661 --> 00:58:40,978
I’m so silly.

1079
00:58:42,700 --> 00:58:43,741
It’s good, though.

1080
00:58:44,040 --> 00:58:45,876
Because now I know how much you love me.

1081
00:58:49,107 --> 00:58:49,870
Okay?

1082
00:58:53,796 --> 00:58:54,941
Stop crying.

1083
00:58:59,058 --> 00:59:01,181
Being together like this is good.

1084
00:59:01,820 --> 00:59:02,818
Yeah.

1085
00:59:10,880 --> 00:59:11,747
Faifa.

1086
00:59:13,150 --> 00:59:13,883
Yotha.

1087
00:59:15,210 --> 00:59:16,590
Aren’t you going home for the weekend?

1088
00:59:20,369 --> 00:59:22,360
Did you see me pack my bags yesterday?

1089
00:59:22,850 --> 00:59:24,178
How would I know?

1090
00:59:24,732 --> 00:59:25,249
I asked you nicely.

1091
00:59:25,280 --> 00:59:26,516
Why did you have to say it like that?

1092
00:59:27,280 --> 00:59:28,276
Aren’t you going home?

1093
00:59:30,510 --> 00:59:31,673
Mom lets me go home

1094
00:59:32,170 --> 00:59:33,175
twice a month.

1095
00:59:39,120 --> 00:59:40,350
A senior asked me to give this to you.

1096
00:59:45,304 --> 00:59:47,520
PERSONAL INFORMATION QUESTIONS

1097
00:59:49,218 --> 00:59:51,895
I already gave this info
when I applied to study here.

1098
00:59:52,900 --> 00:59:53,895
Do I have to fill it out again?

1099
00:59:55,981 --> 00:59:57,070
Hmm.

1100
00:59:57,450 --> 00:59:59,710
This food allergy question, I understand.

1101
01:00:00,160 --> 01:00:02,160
But my favorite color and food?

1102
01:00:02,420 --> 01:00:03,760
Why do they want to know?

1103
01:00:05,610 --> 01:00:06,504
Have you filled out this form?

1104
01:00:07,350 --> 01:00:08,110
Yes.

1105
01:00:09,747 --> 01:00:11,740
Who do I hand this to once I finish filling it out?

1106
01:00:12,295 --> 01:00:13,710
The teachers or the seniors?

1107
01:00:14,110 --> 01:00:14,855
Me.

1108
01:00:15,890 --> 01:00:16,418
Huh?

1109
01:00:17,980 --> 01:00:19,292
The teacher asked me to collect it.

1110
01:00:21,290 --> 01:00:21,876
Oh.

1111
01:00:22,375 --> 01:00:22,972
Okay.

1112
01:00:23,500 --> 01:00:24,295
Let me fill it out.

1113
01:00:26,290 --> 01:00:27,698
Favorite food.

1114
01:00:28,516 --> 01:00:29,661
Favorite color.

1115
01:00:33,660 --> 01:00:37,267
Best friend’s contact?

1116
01:00:41,980 --> 01:00:43,889
Whose name did you put for this question?

1117
01:00:45,130 --> 01:00:46,000
I left it blank.

1118
01:00:46,510 --> 01:00:47,883
What? Come on.

1119
01:00:48,970 --> 01:00:50,547
I can be your best friend.

1120
01:00:51,250 --> 01:00:52,073
No.

1121
01:00:53,260 --> 01:00:54,412
I don’t want a dog as a friend.

1122
01:00:54,880 --> 01:00:55,889
Seriously?

1123
01:00:56,300 --> 01:00:58,418
Did I bark in my sleep?

1124
01:00:59,070 --> 01:01:00,609
Why do you keep scolding me?

1125
01:01:01,415 --> 01:01:02,313
Aeagle.

1126
01:01:02,350 --> 01:01:03,772
I said I’m a beagle.

1127
01:01:22,140 --> 01:01:22,996
Why are you staring at me?

1128
01:01:23,770 --> 01:01:24,929
Looking like a dog

1129
01:01:26,090 --> 01:01:27,286
is not a bad thing.

1130
01:01:28,170 --> 01:01:28,701
What?

1131
01:01:31,200 --> 01:01:31,889
It’s cute.

How’s it going?

1138
01:02:01,624 --> 01:02:03,015
Have you gotten any closer with Yotha?

1139
01:02:03,450 --> 01:02:04,947
I’m closer with him now.

1140
01:02:06,600 --> 01:02:08,430
Are you sure that’s normal, Ears?

1141
01:02:08,449 --> 01:02:08,929
Yeah.

1142
01:02:09,070 --> 01:02:10,061
Why are you guys shocked?

1143
01:02:10,092 --> 01:02:11,360
We’re roommates.

1144
01:02:12,140 --> 01:02:13,495
You really look like a beagle.

1145
01:02:13,790 --> 01:02:15,600
If you trip in the engineering courtyard,

1146
01:02:15,944 --> 01:02:17,126
you’ll get a partner who’s in Engineering.

1147
01:02:17,163 --> 01:02:18,153
What a bummer.

1148
01:02:18,590 --> 01:02:19,920
I wished this was the courtyard.

1149
01:02:20,960 --> 01:02:24,153
I want to know
if you can accept me for who I am.

1150
01:02:24,344 --> 01:02:25,618
Don’t have nightmares, Yotha.
