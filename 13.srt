1
00:00:00,290 --> 00:00:01,301
About last night,

2
00:00:01,541 --> 00:00:02,581
I’m sorry.

3
00:00:02,603 --> 00:00:03,825
I’m scared of losing you.

4
00:00:03,847 --> 00:00:06,414
It’s the Perfect 10 Liners bracelet, Gun.

5
00:00:06,450 --> 00:00:07,818
You might be able to get one,

6
00:00:07,840 --> 00:00:10,080
if you’re dating someone in our group.

7
00:00:10,109 --> 00:00:10,938
Drink some milk.

8
00:00:10,952 --> 00:00:12,465
Faifa is allergic to cow’s milk.

9
00:00:12,581 --> 00:00:14,698
You must’ve confused me with Yotha.

10
00:00:14,749 --> 00:00:16,370
You’re scared of love.

11
00:00:16,421 --> 00:00:19,927
But have you ever thought that
one day someone might make you believe in it again?

12
00:00:21,070 --> 00:00:23,214
Once I can love again,

13
00:00:24,480 --> 00:00:26,581
you must take responsibility for my feelings.

14
00:00:34,218 --> 00:00:35,294
Oh.

15
00:00:37,690 --> 00:00:41,454
Ugh, I have a headache!

16
00:00:42,580 --> 00:00:45,090
I won’t drink again!

17
00:00:45,780 --> 00:00:46,501
Hey.

18
00:00:46,960 --> 00:00:49,207
You say that every time but you can never do it.

19
00:00:51,010 --> 00:00:53,636
Please just know how I feel, not what I’m up to.

20
00:00:54,610 --> 00:00:57,745
I’ll get you something hot to eat
so you’ll feel better.

21
00:00:58,700 --> 00:00:59,541
Hey.

22
00:01:01,250 --> 00:01:03,396
I can't imagine how single people get hangovers

23
00:01:03,425 --> 00:01:06,167
when I have someone to lean on every day.

24
00:01:07,400 --> 00:01:09,127
You don’t just have a boyfriend to lean on,

25
00:01:09,170 --> 00:01:10,603
but also to kiss.

26
00:01:10,632 --> 00:01:11,309
Here.

27
00:01:14,632 --> 00:01:15,345
Stop it!

28
00:03:00,680 --> 00:03:01,614
Hmm?

29
00:03:03,970 --> 00:03:04,901
Hmm?

30
00:03:06,710 --> 00:03:07,716
Can you tie my tie?

31
00:03:26,900 --> 00:03:28,770
You don’t run to brush your teeth first these days.

32
00:03:32,080 --> 00:03:33,265
No.

33
00:03:33,643 --> 00:03:34,996
We’re close now.

34
00:03:48,030 --> 00:03:48,850
What are you doing?

35
00:03:52,600 --> 00:03:53,600
Keep it on.

36
00:03:54,820 --> 00:03:55,752
It’s cute.

37
00:04:03,060 --> 00:04:04,436
Do you have a morning class?

38
00:04:05,490 --> 00:04:07,287
You’re so unlucky.

39
00:04:08,700 --> 00:04:09,781
It’s an all-majors class.

40
00:04:10,785 --> 00:04:12,472
Ah, an all-majors class.

41
00:04:15,780 --> 00:04:16,763
An all-majors class?

42
00:04:17,730 --> 00:04:19,760
I’m in that class with you.

43
00:04:19,810 --> 00:04:21,760
Why didn’t you wake me up sooner?

44
00:04:22,450 --> 00:04:23,701
There’s still time.

45
00:04:24,640 --> 00:04:26,036
What’s wrong with you?

46
00:04:26,960 --> 00:04:28,130
Don’t mess with me.

47
00:04:36,000 --> 00:04:37,563
Where are Gun and your brother?

48
00:04:37,592 --> 00:04:39,192
They can’t skip this class.

49
00:04:39,665 --> 00:04:40,916
I don’t know.

50
00:04:41,083 --> 00:04:42,210
They said they’re running here.

51
00:04:42,232 --> 00:04:44,210
Yotha Thanawan…

52
00:04:48,570 --> 00:04:51,345
Yotha Thanawanyotha.

53
00:04:51,367 --> 00:04:52,145
Here.

54
00:04:52,630 --> 00:04:54,327
Gunyukhol Jiraroj.

55
00:04:56,320 --> 00:04:57,381
We came together.

56
00:05:09,600 --> 00:05:10,538
Come here.

57
00:05:17,469 --> 00:05:18,043
Come on.

58
00:05:18,080 --> 00:05:19,040
Sit with me.

59
00:05:25,920 --> 00:05:27,440
I don’t usually sit here.

60
00:05:28,450 --> 00:05:30,058
Why would you sit alone?

61
00:05:30,087 --> 00:05:31,629
Just sit here together.

62
00:05:34,380 --> 00:05:35,709
Hi, bro.

63
00:05:42,620 --> 00:05:44,036
You almost didn’t make it in time.

64
00:05:45,156 --> 00:05:47,150
I forgot to wake up.

65
00:05:47,461 --> 00:05:49,520
Why didn’t you ask your roommate to wake you up?

66
00:05:50,000 --> 00:05:52,414
We’re both late, didn’t you see?

67
00:05:58,210 --> 00:05:58,632
Hi.

68
00:05:58,669 --> 00:05:59,592
Hi.

69
00:06:02,980 --> 00:06:03,410
Hey.o

70
00:06:03,454 --> 00:06:04,596
Our friends said hi.

71
00:06:05,200 --> 00:06:06,443
Say hi back.

72
00:06:07,610 --> 00:06:09,221
This is Yotha, guys.

73
00:06:09,250 --> 00:06:10,894
These are Kong,

74
00:06:10,923 --> 00:06:12,800
Franc, and Book.

75
00:06:20,150 --> 00:06:21,185
Hi.

76
00:06:24,785 --> 00:06:26,589
Yotha is about to have friends now.

77
00:06:26,610 --> 00:06:29,352
I’ve never seen him have any friends in my life.

78
00:06:29,367 --> 00:06:31,098
Why am I crying?

79
00:06:33,290 --> 00:06:35,105
Yotha is about to have friends.

80
00:06:39,310 --> 00:06:40,407
I’m hungry.

81
00:06:40,603 --> 00:06:42,400
Let’s go eat.

82
00:06:43,220 --> 00:06:43,949
Let’s go.

83
00:06:45,560 --> 00:06:46,610
Where are you going?

84
00:06:49,120 --> 00:06:50,363
Come eat with us.

85
00:06:57,920 --> 00:06:58,567
Let’s go.

86
00:07:04,800 --> 00:07:06,487
Why are you eating the same thing as Gun?

87
00:07:08,480 --> 00:07:09,774
I don’t know what else to eat.

88
00:07:10,540 --> 00:07:12,981
But there are like ten places to choose from.

89
00:07:14,910 --> 00:07:16,967
None of your business.

90
00:07:18,240 --> 00:07:19,847
Hey, Gun.

91
00:07:19,890 --> 00:07:21,840
I heard you went to Bang On yesterday.

92
00:07:21,883 --> 00:07:22,916
How was it?

93
00:07:22,967 --> 00:07:23,760
I heard it’s great.

94
00:07:23,781 --> 00:07:24,421
Yeah.

95
00:07:24,443 --> 00:07:25,250
Is that true?

96
00:07:25,272 --> 00:07:26,516
I’ve never been there.

97
00:07:26,538 --> 00:07:28,101
It’s just a normal bar.

98
00:07:30,720 --> 00:07:31,490
You were wasted.

99
00:07:31,512 --> 00:07:32,487
How would you know?

100
00:07:32,690 --> 00:07:34,021
Shut up.

101
00:07:39,410 --> 00:07:40,509
You take such good care of him.

102
00:07:41,820 --> 00:07:44,509
I just owe him.

103
00:07:45,560 --> 00:07:48,065
Taking the straw out is the least of it.

104
00:07:48,100 --> 00:07:50,610
I also clean the toilet

105
00:07:50,654 --> 00:07:51,941
and mop the floor for him,

106
00:07:52,800 --> 00:07:54,676
in exchange for him to keep the lights on when I sleep.

107
00:07:55,032 --> 00:07:55,956
Yeah.

108
00:07:57,330 --> 00:07:58,821
I didn’t ask you to do any of that.

109
00:07:59,120 --> 00:07:59,854
Hey.

110
00:08:00,770 --> 00:08:02,370
I have a conscience, okay?

111
00:08:03,070 --> 00:08:04,130
You jerk.

112
00:08:04,167 --> 00:08:05,774
You’re making me feel unappreciated.

113
00:08:07,170 --> 00:08:08,101
You’re being rude.

114
00:08:08,600 --> 00:08:09,512
Sorry.

115
00:08:09,745 --> 00:08:11,083
Let me try again.

116
00:08:12,560 --> 00:08:15,170
Yotha, you’re such a jerk, sir.

117
00:08:15,200 --> 00:08:16,967
You’re bad by nature.

118
00:08:18,600 --> 00:08:19,730
What did your mom tell you?

119
00:08:20,930 --> 00:08:22,349
She said you should be polite to your friends.

120
00:08:22,960 --> 00:08:24,472
What you said wasn’t cute.

121
00:08:25,410 --> 00:08:26,770
Cute, what?

122
00:08:26,814 --> 00:08:28,356
I’m scary.

123
00:08:35,025 --> 00:08:37,020
This is the first time I’ve seen you laugh.

124
00:08:37,047 --> 00:08:38,807
You could’ve told me you liked someone scary.

125
00:08:41,540 --> 00:08:42,436
You talk too much.

126
00:08:42,465 --> 00:08:43,607
Start eating already.

127
00:08:44,472 --> 00:08:47,345
You two
are just like me and my partner.

128
00:08:48,050 --> 00:08:49,272
Your partner likes someone scary too?

129
00:08:49,294 --> 00:08:51,789
No, I mean when we started flirting with each other.

130
00:08:51,818 --> 00:08:53,127
We teased each other just like this.

131
00:08:53,127 --> 00:08:54,763
Franc!

132
00:08:56,440 --> 00:08:57,309
Sorry.

133
00:08:57,670 --> 00:08:58,960
I talk too much.

134
00:09:00,960 --> 00:09:02,145
Let’s eat.

135
00:09:04,540 --> 00:09:05,469
Eat.

136
00:09:07,900 --> 00:09:09,760
The whole class got an F.

137
00:09:09,796 --> 00:09:12,181
I’m so lucky I’m not in that class.

138
00:09:12,210 --> 00:09:12,836
Yeah.

139
00:09:12,872 --> 00:09:14,029
Otherwise, I’d be in trouble.

140
00:09:14,390 --> 00:09:15,352
Hey, guys.

141
00:09:15,629 --> 00:09:17,350
Don’t we have more friends than usual today?

142
00:09:17,800 --> 00:09:18,749
Yeah.

143
00:09:19,040 --> 00:09:20,174
It’s like when I’m with you.

144
00:09:20,196 --> 00:09:21,287
It’s just as chaotic.

145
00:09:21,600 --> 00:09:22,305
Hey!

146
00:09:22,830 --> 00:09:23,520
You’re scolding me again!

147
00:09:23,570 --> 00:09:24,225
Hey.

148
00:09:26,421 --> 00:09:28,072
Faifa. Yotha.

149
00:09:29,540 --> 00:09:30,240
Mom.

150
00:09:39,170 --> 00:09:40,458
Take Gun to his room.

151
00:09:40,480 --> 00:09:41,381
I’ll catch up with you later.

152
00:09:42,160 --> 00:09:43,054
Okay.

153
00:09:43,083 --> 00:09:43,614
Let’s go.

154
00:09:43,898 --> 00:09:44,661
Huh?

155
00:09:45,287 --> 00:09:45,985
Let’s go.

156
00:09:56,014 --> 00:09:58,196
I got back and I'm about to leave again,

157
00:09:58,225 --> 00:10:00,029
but I haven't seen you until now, Yotha.

158
00:10:00,430 --> 00:10:01,912
Is something the matter?

159
00:10:02,487 --> 00:10:04,480
I just came to see you.

160
00:10:05,360 --> 00:10:07,701
I’m flying back abroad next week.

161
00:10:09,556 --> 00:10:10,778
You’re leaving already?

162
00:10:11,370 --> 00:10:12,349
Yeah.

163
00:10:14,741 --> 00:10:16,669
During school holidays,

164
00:10:17,260 --> 00:10:19,898
if you want to go on vacation
or join a summer school there,

165
00:10:19,949 --> 00:10:21,512
just let me know.

166
00:10:21,563 --> 00:10:22,574
Your siblings miss you.

167
00:10:22,596 --> 00:10:23,585
I’m not going.

168
00:10:25,400 --> 00:10:26,334
Calm down.

169
00:10:29,850 --> 00:10:31,018
I’m not going there

170
00:10:31,047 --> 00:10:33,272
and you can’t take Faifa or Newton there either.

171
00:10:34,240 --> 00:10:36,021
We’re very happy here.

172
00:10:36,450 --> 00:10:37,723
It’s best if you leave us alone.

173
00:10:41,352 --> 00:10:43,350
Do you hate me that much?

174
00:10:44,450 --> 00:10:45,614
I don’t hate you.

175
00:10:46,130 --> 00:10:47,730
I just don’t give you any importance.

176
00:10:47,760 --> 00:10:48,923
Yotha!

177
00:10:50,960 --> 00:10:51,781
If there’s anything…

178
00:10:51,818 --> 00:10:52,705
There’s nothing.

179
00:10:53,880 --> 00:10:55,585
Stay away from us.

180
00:10:55,614 --> 00:10:56,967
Leave us alone already.

181
00:10:58,960 --> 00:11:00,087
Yotha.

182
00:11:00,123 --> 00:11:01,381
Yotha, son.

183
00:11:04,509 --> 00:11:05,229
Yotha.

184
00:11:07,380 --> 00:11:08,385
Faifa.

185
00:11:26,160 --> 00:11:27,578
Will you calm down?

186
00:11:28,450 --> 00:11:31,221
It’s not the time to act like a good mom now.

187
00:11:31,250 --> 00:11:34,152
The best thing is for her to get out of our lives.

188
00:11:34,494 --> 00:11:35,498
Do you understand?

189
00:11:37,810 --> 00:11:39,483
Can’t you just talk nicely?

190
00:11:47,480 --> 00:11:48,960
Are you going to New’s bar again?

191
00:11:49,450 --> 00:11:50,174
Mm.

192
00:11:52,880 --> 00:11:54,778
Can I go with you?

193
00:11:55,127 --> 00:11:56,363
Not tonight.

194
00:11:57,770 --> 00:11:58,349
Oh.

195
00:11:58,920 --> 00:11:59,716
Why not?

196
00:12:04,560 --> 00:12:08,981
Can I ask you not to go there tonight?

197
00:12:10,130 --> 00:12:12,145
I don’t want you to do anything bad again.

198
00:12:12,500 --> 00:12:13,447
I don’t want you to get hurt.

199
00:12:13,825 --> 00:12:15,040
I don’t want you to be in danger.

200
00:12:15,380 --> 00:12:16,472
It’s my life.

201
00:12:16,509 --> 00:12:17,680
How is it any of your business?

202
00:12:37,541 --> 00:12:39,287
You shouldn’t have been that harsh.

203
00:12:39,650 --> 00:12:40,400
She’s still our mom.

204
00:12:40,429 --> 00:12:42,501
I don’t like how she treats us like objects,

205
00:12:43,020 --> 00:12:45,912
as if she can just pick us up
or leave us anywhere she wants.

206
00:12:45,941 --> 00:12:51,352
You saw how hurt Fai was
after being sent back when she started a new family.

207
00:12:52,260 --> 00:12:53,207
I know,

208
00:12:54,160 --> 00:12:55,760
but Fai has us now.

209
00:13:05,190 --> 00:13:06,036
Calm down.

210
00:13:08,250 --> 00:13:09,760
I know how you feel.

211
00:13:09,985 --> 00:13:12,349
Will you guys stop acting like you understand me?

212
00:13:13,832 --> 00:13:15,830
No one understands me at all.

213
00:13:29,510 --> 00:13:31,381
Cry it out.

214
00:13:39,840 --> 00:13:43,265
When you’re with me, you don’t have to be strong.

215
00:14:00,560 --> 00:14:02,363
What the hell are you doing?

216
00:14:03,580 --> 00:14:04,378
You won’t stop, huh?

217
00:14:04,407 --> 00:14:05,061
Klao, stop!

218
00:14:05,090 --> 00:14:05,970
Klao!

219
00:14:13,540 --> 00:14:14,203
You bastard!

220
00:14:17,860 --> 00:14:19,221
What the hell is wrong with you?

221
00:14:19,243 --> 00:14:20,778
When are you going to leave my boyfriend alone?

222
00:14:20,807 --> 00:14:22,378
If you’re so possessive of him,

223
00:14:22,734 --> 00:14:23,992
why don’t you just chain him up?

224
00:14:24,014 --> 00:14:25,243
Watch it!

225
00:14:31,240 --> 00:14:32,080
Wa.

226
00:14:32,407 --> 00:14:34,080
Will you get it together?

227
00:14:35,200 --> 00:14:37,658
Yotha and I broke up a long time ago.

228
00:14:38,210 --> 00:14:40,720
So long that we’re just brothers now.

229
00:14:41,541 --> 00:14:44,341
But if you keep on not trusting me,

230
00:14:45,980 --> 00:14:47,934
I don’t know what to do anymore.

231
00:14:53,730 --> 00:14:54,923
I’ve made my decision.

232
00:14:56,974 --> 00:14:58,123
Let’s break up, Klao.

233
00:14:58,430 --> 00:14:59,112
Wa.

234
00:14:59,990 --> 00:15:00,938
Wa.

235
00:15:02,140 --> 00:15:02,952
Wa.

236
00:15:04,080 --> 00:15:04,967
Wa.

237
00:15:06,900 --> 00:15:07,883
Wa.

238
00:15:07,912 --> 00:15:09,403
Can we talk?

239
00:15:09,432 --> 00:15:10,269
Wa.

240
00:15:10,560 --> 00:15:11,469
Can we please talk?

241
00:15:11,498 --> 00:15:12,727
No, can you please not go?

242
00:15:12,750 --> 00:15:14,378
Can we not break up?

243
00:15:14,654 --> 00:15:15,847
Wa.

244
00:15:17,134 --> 00:15:19,352
Can you stay with me, Wa?

245
00:15:20,145 --> 00:15:22,298
Can we not break up?

246
00:15:41,381 --> 00:15:42,290
Let me see.

247
00:15:44,020 --> 00:15:44,930
Does it hurt?

248
00:15:46,440 --> 00:15:47,760
Do you want me to dress your wound?

249
00:15:50,410 --> 00:15:52,843
Your logic on life sucks.

250
00:15:53,400 --> 00:15:54,996
If everything could recover by itself,

251
00:15:55,032 --> 00:15:56,370
we wouldn’t need any doctors.

252
00:15:56,414 --> 00:15:57,258
Nuisance.

253
00:15:59,032 --> 00:16:01,250
I’m worried about you, not being a nuisance.

254
00:16:02,690 --> 00:16:05,403
Can I ask you not to go there tonight?

255
00:16:05,410 --> 00:16:06,778
I don’t want you to get hurt.

256
00:16:06,829 --> 00:16:08,203
I don’t want you to be in danger.

257
00:16:09,570 --> 00:16:10,225
What?

258
00:16:12,580 --> 00:16:13,680
Yotha!

259
00:16:20,180 --> 00:16:22,247
Hey. Did you go out to eat congee again?

260
00:16:22,276 --> 00:16:22,894
Yes.

261
00:16:23,847 --> 00:16:25,178
The power went out on the 4th floor.

262
00:16:26,400 --> 00:16:27,549
Since what time?

263
00:16:27,578 --> 00:16:29,098
About two hours ago.

264
00:16:29,127 --> 00:16:30,814
Right when people were sleeping.

265
00:16:30,843 --> 00:16:32,363
I don’t think anyone knows yet.

266
00:16:32,400 --> 00:16:34,152
The technicians are working on it.

267
00:16:34,581 --> 00:16:36,007
They’ll probably be done in less than an hour.

268
00:16:40,800 --> 00:16:41,716
Gun.

269
00:16:41,745 --> 00:16:42,436
Gun.

270
00:16:43,370 --> 00:16:44,138
Gun.

271
00:16:45,020 --> 00:16:45,796
Help me.

272
00:16:45,890 --> 00:16:46,603
Beagle.

273
00:16:47,300 --> 00:16:48,000
Beagle, wake up.

274
00:16:48,036 --> 00:16:49,054
Is anyone out there?

275
00:16:49,076 --> 00:16:49,956
Help me.

276
00:16:50,470 --> 00:16:51,432
Gunyukhol.

277
00:16:52,980 --> 00:16:53,687
Gun.

278
00:16:55,767 --> 00:16:56,632
Yotha.

279
00:17:02,630 --> 00:17:03,607
It’s okay.

280
00:17:04,570 --> 00:17:06,283
I had a nightmare again.

281
00:17:06,850 --> 00:17:07,549
It’s just a dream.

282
00:17:07,578 --> 00:17:09,120
It’s okay, Gun.

283
00:17:10,109 --> 00:17:13,527
I dreamed that you were leaving me.

284
00:17:15,170 --> 00:17:16,763
How could I leave you?

285
00:17:29,340 --> 00:17:30,807
Your face is wounded again.

286
00:17:32,170 --> 00:17:33,149
It doesn’t hurt.

287
00:17:34,610 --> 00:17:35,716
Let me…

288
00:17:35,738 --> 00:17:36,858
It’s my life.

289
00:17:36,872 --> 00:17:38,072
How is it any of your business?

290
00:17:45,120 --> 00:17:46,087
I forgot.

291
00:17:47,660 --> 00:17:49,527
You can take care of your life just fine.

292
00:17:52,460 --> 00:17:53,469
I’m going to sleep now.

293
00:18:01,460 --> 00:18:02,967
Don’t have nightmares, Beagle.

294
00:18:04,960 --> 00:18:05,672
Mm.

295
00:18:44,020 --> 00:18:46,130
Some of us freshmen have started wearing the jacket.

296
00:19:11,030 --> 00:19:12,407
Don’t you get what I’m saying?

297
00:19:14,230 --> 00:19:15,374
Can you tie my tie?

298
00:19:53,700 --> 00:19:54,858
I don’t want to tie it for you anymore.

299
00:20:00,100 --> 00:20:01,156
Sorry.

300
00:20:06,090 --> 00:20:06,770
No.

301
00:20:09,600 --> 00:20:10,458
Beagle.

302
00:20:12,220 --> 00:20:13,578
Can you please tie my tie?

303
00:20:13,614 --> 00:20:15,530
I said we can wear the jacket now.

304
00:20:15,716 --> 00:20:16,741
I want to wear this uniform.

305
00:20:17,738 --> 00:20:19,730
I want you to tie my tie, Beagle.

306
00:20:49,480 --> 00:20:50,567
Have you stopped being mad at me?

307
00:20:52,850 --> 00:20:53,461
No.

308
00:20:56,650 --> 00:20:57,738
What should I do?

309
00:20:57,774 --> 00:20:58,523
I don’t know.

310
00:21:00,460 --> 00:21:01,578
Sorry.

311
00:21:04,830 --> 00:21:06,821
I really don’t know how to make up with you.

312
00:21:08,750 --> 00:21:10,887
I’ve done everything I know how to do.

313
00:21:13,963 --> 00:21:15,505
That’s how you’re trying to make up with me?

314
00:21:17,047 --> 00:21:17,629
Mm.

315
00:21:18,950 --> 00:21:20,283

Me too.

330
00:22:27,716 --> 00:22:29,690
I think I look so cool.

331
00:22:29,745 --> 00:22:32,000
I want to walk around the uni today.

332
00:22:32,880 --> 00:22:34,880
Shall we go this evening?

333
00:22:36,880 --> 00:22:37,905
Count me in.

334
00:22:38,152 --> 00:22:39,900
Fai, don’t tell me…

335
00:22:40,152 --> 00:22:41,520
You’re right.

336
00:22:41,592 --> 00:22:43,381
I’m the God of good fortune.

337
00:22:43,447 --> 00:22:45,585
Even in this all-majors class,
I ended up in the same section as you guys.

338
00:22:45,636 --> 00:22:47,367
Good fortune?

339
00:22:47,410 --> 00:22:48,661
You chose the same section as us.

340
00:22:48,930 --> 00:22:50,436
I’m lonely.

341
00:22:50,487 --> 00:22:51,389
Anyway,

342
00:22:51,800 --> 00:22:52,960
how do I look in this jacket?

343
00:22:53,810 --> 00:22:55,549
Whoa!

344
00:22:55,563 --> 00:22:57,061
Whoa!

345
00:22:57,260 --> 00:22:58,181
Do I look more handsome now?

346
00:22:58,320 --> 00:22:59,556
I’ll give you a score.

347
00:23:00,010 --> 00:23:00,930
A middle score. About this.

348
00:23:00,967 --> 00:23:02,349
That’s all you can get.

349
00:23:02,970 --> 00:23:03,970
Stop talking.

350
00:23:04,950 --> 00:23:06,487
But now that we’re wearing the jacket,

351
00:23:06,538 --> 00:23:08,814
we won’t get to see this scene anymore.

352
00:23:13,580 --> 00:23:14,276
Beagle. Beagle.

353
00:23:14,327 --> 00:23:15,330
Beagle what?

354
00:23:15,380 --> 00:23:17,258
He sounded just like him.

355
00:23:17,280 --> 00:23:18,152
Stop it.

356
00:23:18,190 --> 00:23:18,669
Stop it.

357
00:23:18,698 --> 00:23:19,214
Beagle. Beagle.

358
00:23:19,243 --> 00:23:20,698
Come on, let me tie your tie.

359
00:23:21,010 --> 00:23:21,767
Stop it.

360
00:23:22,000 --> 00:23:23,301
I don’t want you to tie it.

361
00:23:23,338 --> 00:23:24,320
You’re annoying.

362
00:23:24,356 --> 00:23:25,149
Yotha!

363
00:23:25,170 --> 00:23:25,890
Wait!

364
00:23:25,927 --> 00:23:26,763
Beagle. Beagle.

365
00:23:27,420 --> 00:23:27,970
Stop teasing me.

366
00:23:28,000 --> 00:23:28,705
Stop it.

367
00:23:28,741 --> 00:23:30,123
- Beagle will tie it for you.
- 	Stop it.

368
00:23:30,990 --> 00:23:31,730
Stop it.

369
00:23:31,767 --> 00:23:32,283
Stop.

370
00:23:34,300 --> 00:23:34,952
Faifa.

371
00:23:34,950 --> 00:23:36,443
Why isn’t Yotha wearing the jacket?

372
00:23:38,010 --> 00:23:39,083
You’re about to find out.

373
00:23:39,483 --> 00:23:40,181
What are you whispering about?

374
00:23:40,218 --> 00:23:40,807
Nothing.

375
00:23:43,090 --> 00:23:43,956
Why are you smiling?

376
00:23:49,480 --> 00:23:51,476
Beagle, can you tie my tie?

377
00:23:51,956 --> 00:23:53,950
I already tied it this morning.

378
00:23:54,780 --> 00:23:55,687
It came off.

379
00:23:55,716 --> 00:23:56,865
It’s the second semester.

380
00:23:56,909 --> 00:23:58,210
You can wear the jacket now.

381
00:23:58,225 --> 00:23:59,432
I don’t like wearing the jacket.

382
00:24:00,320 --> 00:24:01,876
You can just wear the shirt.

383
00:24:01,912 --> 00:24:03,527
No need to follow the rules anymore.

384
00:24:03,800 --> 00:24:05,170
I want you to keep tying it for me.

385
00:24:05,940 --> 00:24:07,127
Are you messing with me?

386
00:24:07,141 --> 00:24:09,120
I want you to keep tying it for me.

387
00:24:25,940 --> 00:24:28,770
We’re meeting tonight to send Arc off to his internship.

388
00:24:28,814 --> 00:24:29,985
He asked me to invite you.

389
00:24:31,110 --> 00:24:32,269
What does it have to do with me?

390
00:24:32,800 --> 00:24:34,225
You’re Arm’s favorite junior,

391
00:24:34,647 --> 00:24:35,956
so they’re inviting you.

392
00:24:39,280 --> 00:24:40,320
Where are you guys going?

393
00:24:40,360 --> 00:24:41,367
Bang On?

394
00:24:41,396 --> 00:24:41,978
No.

395
00:24:42,810 --> 00:24:43,854
Newton’s bar.

396
00:24:45,850 --> 00:24:47,025
Why there?

397
00:24:47,920 --> 00:24:49,403
Just wanted a different vibe.

398
00:24:50,730 --> 00:24:51,680
Fai will be there too.

399
00:24:55,985 --> 00:24:56,996
Why are you going?

400
00:24:57,032 --> 00:24:58,756
You’re not part of the Perfect 10 Liners.

401
00:24:58,792 --> 00:25:00,778
I’m the owner’s brother.

402
00:25:00,820 --> 00:25:02,152
Why can’t I go?

403
00:25:02,167 --> 00:25:03,860
You’re the one who’s not part of this, Ears.

404
00:25:10,400 --> 00:25:12,232
Bro, your tie looks good.

405
00:25:12,910 --> 00:25:14,443
Hurry up and sit down.

406
00:25:14,465 --> 00:25:16,440
The whole class is shy.

407
00:25:22,167 --> 00:25:23,570
They’re late again.

408
00:25:23,614 --> 00:25:24,865
They’ll be here soon.

409
00:25:25,440 --> 00:25:26,021
Come here!

410
00:25:26,580 --> 00:25:26,952
Hi.

411
00:25:26,960 --> 00:25:28,269
Have a seat.

412
00:25:28,290 --> 00:25:29,069
Have a seat.

413
00:25:29,098 --> 00:25:30,298
Come on.

414
00:25:30,327 --> 00:25:31,447
Hi, guys.

415
00:25:31,476 --> 00:25:31,876
Hi.

416
00:25:31,898 --> 00:25:33,461
You know Arc and Arm?

417
00:25:33,512 --> 00:25:34,458
In passing.

418
00:25:34,487 --> 00:25:37,156
Newton and I used to see Arc at the football field.

419
00:25:37,200 --> 00:25:38,487
It was a very long time ago.

420
00:25:38,500 --> 00:25:39,847
What a small world.

421
00:25:39,869 --> 00:25:42,181
Once I heard Arc is in some group with Yotha,

422
00:25:43,360 --> 00:25:44,778
we reconnected a bit.

423
00:25:46,190 --> 00:25:48,065
You’re in trouble, Yotha.

424
00:25:48,094 --> 00:25:50,538
The Perfect 10 Liners will break your neck.

425
00:25:50,980 --> 00:25:53,767
No wonder Arc and Newton know so much about you.

426
00:25:57,940 --> 00:25:59,789
Warich is probably at the back.

427
00:26:00,065 --> 00:26:00,574
I’ll…

428
00:26:00,610 --> 00:26:02,196
No, it’s okay.

429
00:26:02,247 --> 00:26:03,876
I’m just going to the toilet.

430
00:26:14,160 --> 00:26:14,690
Come on.

431
00:26:14,734 --> 00:26:15,847
Don’t talk too much.

432
00:26:15,869 --> 00:26:16,683
Let’s get back to it.

433
00:26:16,730 --> 00:26:17,636
Refill your glass first.

434
00:26:17,680 --> 00:26:19,000
Oh, okay.

435
00:26:20,010 --> 00:26:20,603
Come on, Gun.

436
00:26:20,640 --> 00:26:22,734
Let’s drink. You’re late.

437
00:26:26,450 --> 00:26:27,018
Hey.

438
00:26:28,070 --> 00:26:29,156
Are you all here?

439
00:26:31,520 --> 00:26:32,538
Have you made up with him?

440
00:26:33,540 --> 00:26:34,632
Let’s just say

441
00:26:35,490 --> 00:26:37,163
it’s probably not anytime soon.

442
00:26:39,490 --> 00:26:40,363
Sorry.

443
00:26:41,370 --> 00:26:42,363
Why?

444
00:26:43,927 --> 00:26:45,920
I was part of the reason you broke up with him.

445
00:26:46,610 --> 00:26:48,247
Didn’t you want me to break up with him?

446
00:26:50,240 --> 00:26:51,796
Cheers!

447
00:26:52,960 --> 00:26:54,050
Bottoms up, Gun.

448
00:26:54,087 --> 00:26:54,989
Bottoms up?

449
00:26:55,003 --> 00:26:56,094
Bottoms up!

450
00:26:56,116 --> 00:26:56,981
Bottoms up!

451
00:26:57,010 --> 00:26:57,934
Bottoms up!

452
00:26:57,978 --> 00:26:58,741
Bottoms up!

453
00:26:58,763 --> 00:26:59,585
Bottoms up!

454
00:26:59,607 --> 00:27:00,581
Bottoms up!

455
00:27:00,618 --> 00:27:02,210
Down it!

456
00:27:03,680 --> 00:27:04,516
Great.

457
00:27:10,740 --> 00:27:12,152
You’ll be just fine.

458
00:27:12,370 --> 00:27:13,810
New, where’s the toilet?

459
00:27:13,861 --> 00:27:14,741
What?

460
00:27:15,140 --> 00:27:16,909
Are you taking it out right after taking it in?

461
00:27:16,930 --> 00:27:18,349
When will you get drunk then?

462
00:27:18,392 --> 00:27:20,340
I have to take it out
or I’ll be taken down.

463
00:27:21,170 --> 00:27:22,574
Just head straight.

464
00:27:22,830 --> 00:27:23,570
Okay.

465
00:27:23,600 --> 00:27:24,378
Will you be okay?

466
00:27:24,407 --> 00:27:25,330
Do you want me to go with you?

467
00:27:25,650 --> 00:27:26,349
It’s fine.

468
00:27:26,654 --> 00:27:28,734
I’ll be right back.

469
00:27:29,352 --> 00:27:30,480
Come back and finish it.

470
00:27:30,509 --> 00:27:31,483
I will.

471
00:27:31,512 --> 00:27:32,574
Don’t get drunk yet.

472
00:27:32,603 --> 00:27:33,345
I won’t.

473
00:27:34,930 --> 00:27:36,974
How do you know I want you to break up with him?

474
00:27:37,018 --> 00:27:39,643
Hey, we’re not together anymore.

475
00:27:40,340 --> 00:27:41,200
No one should…

476
00:28:00,870 --> 00:28:02,181
I really don’t feel anything anymore.

477
00:28:05,700 --> 00:28:06,269
Come on.

478
00:28:06,700 --> 00:28:07,752
Let’s go inside.

479
00:28:08,247 --> 00:28:10,094
This heartbroken man is craving alcohol.

480
00:28:19,880 --> 00:28:20,661
Hi.

481
00:28:22,930 --> 00:28:23,840
Where’s Gun?

482
00:28:23,869 --> 00:28:24,792
He went to the toilet.

483
00:28:25,236 --> 00:28:26,589
There he is.

484
00:28:29,220 --> 00:28:31,374
Arc, where’s your internship?

485
00:28:32,390 --> 00:28:33,600
A plant in Rayong.

486
00:28:34,870 --> 00:28:36,014
That’s so far.

487
00:28:36,650 --> 00:28:38,989
Isn’t there a closer plant in Bangkok for you to intern at?

488
00:28:39,018 --> 00:28:39,861
Come on.

489
00:28:39,890 --> 00:28:41,010
It’s just three months.

490
00:28:51,570 --> 00:28:53,440
Whoa, Wa.

491
00:28:53,469 --> 00:28:55,767
It’s already strong. No need to mix it.

492
00:28:55,825 --> 00:28:57,192
You’re going to throw up.

493
00:28:58,730 --> 00:28:59,760
Let him be.

494
00:28:59,810 --> 00:29:01,338
His life is even more bitter than alcohol right now.

495
00:29:01,374 --> 00:29:02,058
Nosy.

496
00:29:02,516 --> 00:29:04,218
What does Yotha have to do with it?

497
00:29:04,240 --> 00:29:05,680
Why are you making him drink that too?

498
00:29:08,421 --> 00:29:10,420
You’re nosy too.

499
00:29:16,420 --> 00:29:17,469
Any more wounds?

500
00:29:17,800 --> 00:29:19,141
Yes, but it’s fine.

501
00:29:19,185 --> 00:29:20,000
Where?

502
00:29:26,730 --> 00:29:27,978
You have a tattoo, Wa?

503
00:29:29,440 --> 00:29:30,916
Oh, yes.

504
00:29:32,050 --> 00:29:33,403
It’s a binary code.

505
00:29:35,650 --> 00:29:37,098
Does it have meaning?

506
00:29:37,134 --> 00:29:37,970
Of course.

507
00:29:38,410 --> 00:29:39,883
It translates to my name.

508
00:29:40,710 --> 00:29:42,167
You’re observant.

509
00:29:43,280 --> 00:29:45,214
It caught my eye.

510
00:29:45,250 --> 00:29:46,145
It’s beautiful.

511
00:29:48,140 --> 00:29:50,140
You know about binary numbers, right?

512
00:29:50,730 --> 00:29:53,789
Yes, but I don’t know how to convert them.

513
00:29:53,818 --> 00:29:55,258
I usually use a calculator.

514
00:29:55,287 --> 00:29:56,560
Wa, you’re bringing this up

515
00:29:56,930 --> 00:29:59,250
because you’re spreading your binary cult again, right?

516
00:29:59,280 --> 00:30:01,454
Don’t listen to him, Gun.

517
00:30:01,770 --> 00:30:04,756
I’m teaching you so you can expand your knowledge.

518
00:30:04,800 --> 00:30:06,174
Please get into it.

519
00:30:07,650 --> 00:30:09,032
Arc, Arm, are you interested?

520
00:30:09,490 --> 00:30:10,698
No.

521
00:30:10,727 --> 00:30:13,141
It’s already hard for me to make sense when I talk.

522
00:30:13,498 --> 00:30:14,880
If I had to translate things,

523
00:30:14,916 --> 00:30:16,487
I wouldn’t be able to talk to anyone.

524
00:30:17,380 --> 00:30:18,181
See?

525
00:30:18,210 --> 00:30:19,825
No one is interested in it,

526
00:30:19,861 --> 00:30:21,520
except you and Yotha.

527
00:30:21,541 --> 00:30:23,098
Why don’t you two go talk about it alone?

528
00:30:45,170 --> 00:30:46,683
You’re cute again, Arc.

529
00:30:47,010 --> 00:30:48,247
Let me kiss you.

530
00:30:52,620 --> 00:30:53,854
We’re leaving.

531
00:30:53,883 --> 00:30:54,458
Arm is drunk.

532
00:30:54,480 --> 00:30:56,007
Drunk? I’m not drunk.

533
00:30:56,036 --> 00:30:56,890
Let’s go.

534
00:30:56,938 --> 00:30:59,090
We’re leaving early again.

535
00:30:59,127 --> 00:31:02,072
I haven’t drunk any alcohol into my mouth.

536
00:31:02,094 --> 00:31:04,770
Alcohol hasn’t gotten into my veins.

537
00:31:04,800 --> 00:31:05,636
Walk carefully.

538
00:31:08,400 --> 00:31:10,610
So, where are you guys staying tonight?

539
00:31:11,890 --> 00:31:13,585
Do you want to stay here or go back to the dorm?

540
00:31:14,850 --> 00:31:15,861
Go back to the dorm.

541
00:31:16,669 --> 00:31:17,978
Then do you want to leave now?

542
00:31:21,860 --> 00:31:22,880
Hey, Yotha.

543
00:31:23,469 --> 00:31:25,156
Can I stay in your room upstairs?

544
00:31:26,050 --> 00:31:27,752
I can’t go back to the dorm.

545
00:31:28,440 --> 00:31:29,047
Mm.

546
00:31:30,261 --> 00:31:31,360
I want to leave now.

547
00:31:32,630 --> 00:31:33,243
Let’s go.

548
00:31:34,109 --> 00:31:35,570
I think I’ll leave too.

549
00:31:35,780 --> 00:31:36,356
Oh?

550
00:31:37,700 --> 00:31:38,996
Bye. See you.

551
00:31:39,040 --> 00:31:40,501
Bye, binary numbers bro.

552
00:31:42,240 --> 00:31:43,098
See you.

553
00:31:43,690 --> 00:31:46,450
What are we waiting for?

554
00:31:46,480 --> 00:31:47,236
Cheers!

555
00:32:07,230 --> 00:32:09,230
You guys can go.

556
00:32:15,570 --> 00:32:16,356
What is it?

557
00:32:17,300 --> 00:32:18,327
I’m not breaking up with you.

558
00:32:18,860 --> 00:32:20,160
I thought we were done
talking about this the other day.

559
00:32:20,196 --> 00:32:21,301
You’re the only one done.

560
00:32:21,338 --> 00:32:22,480
I’m not done.

561
00:32:22,516 --> 00:32:23,389
Klao.

562
00:32:34,220 --> 00:32:35,287
Hey!

563
00:32:35,330 --> 00:32:36,138
Yotha!

564
00:32:36,740 --> 00:32:37,665
Yotha!

565
00:32:44,290 --> 00:32:44,901
Yotha!

566
00:32:44,923 --> 00:32:45,563
Hey!

567
00:32:45,600 --> 00:32:45,978
Stay out of it!

568
00:32:46,014 --> 00:32:46,669
Don’t come closer, Gun!

569
00:32:47,770 --> 00:32:48,807
Hey, stop it!

570
00:32:48,843 --> 00:32:49,469
Klao.

571
00:32:49,498 --> 00:32:50,174
I’ll help my friend.

572
00:32:50,218 --> 00:32:51,585
Are you sticking your nose in too?

573
00:32:51,701 --> 00:32:52,392
You jerk!

574
00:32:52,509 --> 00:32:54,050
What are you doing to my friend?

575
00:33:05,650 --> 00:33:06,385
Klao!

576
00:33:12,618 --> 00:33:13,432
Yotha!

577
00:33:19,940 --> 00:33:21,185
Don’t come any closer!

578
00:33:23,090 --> 00:33:24,138
Hey, what are you doing?

579
00:33:24,167 --> 00:33:24,865
Hey!

580
00:33:28,860 --> 00:33:30,327
This is just a warning!

581
00:33:30,363 --> 00:33:31,767
Don’t mess with my partner again

582
00:33:31,800 --> 00:33:33,163
or you’ll get it worse!

583
00:33:33,200 --> 00:33:33,934
Klao!

584
00:33:37,060 --> 00:33:38,640
Gun, are you okay?

585
00:33:40,470 --> 00:33:41,272
Gun!

586
00:33:41,476 --> 00:33:42,421
Are you okay?

587
00:33:43,050 --> 00:33:44,094
Are you hurt?

588
00:33:45,178 --> 00:33:45,701
No.

589
00:33:45,730 --> 00:33:47,512
I’m not hurt.

590
00:33:53,578 --> 00:33:54,647
Are you okay?

591
00:33:55,100 --> 00:33:55,985
Are you okay, Gun?

592
00:34:18,840 --> 00:34:19,694
All done.

593
00:34:26,610 --> 00:34:27,665
Your hands are shaking.

594
00:34:32,910 --> 00:34:33,963
I’m fine.

595
00:34:35,560 --> 00:34:36,552
Beagle.

596
00:34:39,580 --> 00:34:40,741
Not now, Yotha.

597
00:34:40,763 --> 00:34:41,461
Beagle.

598
00:34:45,680 --> 00:34:47,460
Nop said Klao is fine.

599
00:34:47,723 --> 00:34:48,974
He doesn’t have to be admitted to the hospital.

600
00:34:49,003 --> 00:34:49,774
What about you?

601
00:34:50,327 --> 00:34:51,810
Are you sure you don’t want to go to the hospital?

602
00:34:52,340 --> 00:34:53,076
I’m fine.

603
00:34:54,130 --> 00:34:55,112
Beagle.

604
00:34:59,370 --> 00:35:00,785
Do you know who those guys were?

605
00:35:01,530 --> 00:35:02,160
No.

606
00:35:02,203 --> 00:35:03,338
I’d never seen them before.

607
00:35:03,367 --> 00:35:05,076
When will you stop, Yotha?

608
00:35:05,660 --> 00:35:06,370
Fai.

609
00:35:07,040 --> 00:35:08,385
When will he stop?

610
00:35:08,501 --> 00:35:11,207
Do you want them to shoot you to death first
before you’ll stop?

611
00:35:11,243 --> 00:35:12,254
I’m not afraid to die.

612
00:35:12,290 --> 00:35:13,149
Of course not!

613
00:35:13,170 --> 00:35:14,734
I know you’re not afraid to die.

614
00:35:14,763 --> 00:35:16,443
You can go die wherever you want

615
00:35:16,472 --> 00:35:17,818
but think carefully.

616
00:35:17,847 --> 00:35:19,745
You’re putting other people’s lives at risk.

617
00:35:19,789 --> 00:35:21,740
Klao, Wa, and not to mention Gun.

618
00:35:21,934 --> 00:35:23,740
Are you really okay with that?

619
00:35:30,830 --> 00:35:32,538
It’s been a long day for us.

620
00:35:33,000 --> 00:35:33,607
Let’s go.

621
00:35:35,320 --> 00:35:36,123
Beagle.

622
00:35:36,740 --> 00:35:37,650
It’s late.

623
00:35:37,680 --> 00:35:38,843
Please stay here.

624
00:35:44,640 --> 00:35:46,938
Fai, I want to go back to the dorm.

625
00:35:47,134 --> 00:35:47,701
Let’s go.

626
00:35:49,700 --> 00:35:50,494
Gun!

627
00:35:53,700 --> 00:35:54,698
Get some rest.

628
00:35:55,380 --> 00:35:56,443
You can talk to him tomorrow.

629
00:36:10,870 --> 00:36:11,847
Careful.

630
00:36:19,840 --> 00:36:20,836
Ouch!

631
00:36:26,320 --> 00:36:28,458
You should’ve stayed the night at the hospital.

632
00:36:29,760 --> 00:36:31,112
It’s not that bad.

633
00:36:31,490 --> 00:36:32,283
It is.

634
00:36:32,625 --> 00:36:34,072
It’s very bad.

635
00:36:34,730 --> 00:36:35,847
Don’t argue with me.

636
00:36:35,876 --> 00:36:36,734
Wa.

637
00:36:40,458 --> 00:36:41,898
Can we not break up?

638
00:36:47,680 --> 00:36:48,450
Klao.

639
00:36:50,390 --> 00:36:51,592
I’m sorry.

640
00:36:53,220 --> 00:36:54,705
I’ll try to be better.

641
00:36:56,043 --> 00:36:58,040
I’ll try not to be hotheaded

642
00:36:58,400 --> 00:37:00,560
and I’ll try to be more reasonable.

643
00:37:06,280 --> 00:37:07,789
Why did you help Yotha?

644
00:37:11,650 --> 00:37:12,640
I don’t know.

645
00:37:13,960 --> 00:37:15,650
I just saw he was in trouble.

646
00:37:16,180 --> 00:37:17,272
But you don’t like him.

647
00:37:17,309 --> 00:37:18,727
I hate him.

648
00:37:22,010 --> 00:37:23,883
If you really hated him,

649
00:37:24,247 --> 00:37:26,363
you wouldn’t have decided to help him.

650
00:37:28,360 --> 00:37:32,000
Klao, Yotha deserves so much sympathy.

651
00:37:33,330 --> 00:37:35,330
Before, he only had me,

652
00:37:36,750 --> 00:37:38,567
so he made me his whole world,

653
00:37:39,380 --> 00:37:41,723
but I broke his whole world down.

654
00:37:43,990 --> 00:37:45,760
Why are you telling me this?

655
00:37:45,803 --> 00:37:48,974
Yotha’s world has been created

656
00:37:49,890 --> 00:37:51,920
and broken down so many times.

657
00:37:53,120 --> 00:37:56,000
Until someone else comes in to be his new world,

658
00:37:57,030 --> 00:37:58,749
I probably won’t be able to let him go.

659
00:38:02,530 --> 00:38:03,527
I get it.

660
00:38:04,950 --> 00:38:07,447
But if you can’t accept this, I’ll probably…

661
00:38:07,476 --> 00:38:08,712
I can accept it.

662
00:38:12,210 --> 00:38:14,210
Anything to not lose you.

663
00:38:23,020 --> 00:38:24,385
Please know, Klao,

664
00:38:25,020 --> 00:38:28,210
I’ll never become Yotha’s new world,

665
00:38:29,580 --> 00:38:30,843
because I have you.

666
00:38:31,660 --> 00:38:33,149
You’re my whole world.

667
00:38:43,730 --> 00:38:44,414
Wa.

668
00:38:46,930 --> 00:38:48,007
I love you.

669
00:38:51,090 --> 00:38:52,727
I love you too, Klao.

670
00:38:57,870 --> 00:38:58,625
Ouch!

671
00:39:00,190 --> 00:39:01,200
That hurts.

672
00:39:01,207 --> 00:39:02,116
Get some sleep.

673
00:39:14,420 --> 00:39:15,447
Won’t you hug me?

674
00:39:17,020 --> 00:39:18,014
Aren’t you hurt?

675
00:39:18,189 --> 00:39:20,356
Yes, but I can bear it.

676
00:39:22,100 --> 00:39:23,076
Ouch!

677
00:39:24,930 --> 00:39:26,043
I better not.

678
00:39:42,160 --> 00:39:43,330
Are you okay?

679
00:39:48,700 --> 00:39:49,949
Not really.

680
00:39:51,460 --> 00:39:52,967
What’s bothering you?

681
00:39:55,150 --> 00:39:56,363
Many things.

682
00:39:58,480 --> 00:40:00,574
Can you tell me one by one?

683
00:40:04,570 --> 00:40:09,338
Normally, I only see Yotha’s wounds.

684
00:40:12,450 --> 00:40:15,010
I never knew how he got them.

685
00:40:17,105 --> 00:40:21,149
I’m shocked and scared.

686
00:40:23,265 --> 00:40:24,305
I don’t like this at all.

687
00:40:29,614 --> 00:40:31,610
Is this normal for Yotha?

688
00:40:34,465 --> 00:40:36,254
If you’re asking me if it’s normal,

689
00:40:36,254 --> 00:40:36,269
I don’t think it is.

690
00:40:36,269 --> 00:40:37,745
I don’t think it is.

691
00:40:39,300 --> 00:40:42,749
I want Yotha to be the Yotha I know all the time,

692
00:40:45,540 --> 00:40:47,330
not someone I don’t know like this.

693
00:40:49,330 --> 00:40:50,530
Calm down.

694
00:40:51,410 --> 00:40:52,952
Since he met you,

695
00:40:54,160 --> 00:40:55,810
he’s been trying to change.

696
00:41:03,300 --> 00:41:04,865
Because of me or someone else?

697
00:41:06,500 --> 00:41:07,803
Why do you say that?

698
00:41:10,100 --> 00:41:12,545
I told you I’m not okay with a lot of things.

699
00:41:12,970 --> 00:41:14,370
What is it?

700
00:41:18,240 --> 00:41:20,407
I saw Yotha kissing Wa.

701
00:41:25,738 --> 00:41:26,501
Huh?

702
00:41:31,440 --> 00:41:35,592
It might be something normal for him
that I’m just not used to.

703
00:41:37,500 --> 00:41:38,974
I have no right to stop him

704
00:41:40,210 --> 00:41:42,581
or even ask him anything.

705
00:41:43,214 --> 00:41:43,672
Gun.

706
00:41:43,701 --> 00:41:44,501
Am I right?

707
00:41:44,530 --> 00:41:45,556
Gun, I think…

708
00:41:45,578 --> 00:41:46,210
Fai,

709
00:41:47,992 --> 00:41:49,570
I need your help.

710
00:42:11,541 --> 00:42:12,181
Hey.

711
00:42:12,560 --> 00:42:14,014
Are you sure you’ll be fine?

712
00:42:14,436 --> 00:42:15,745
Look at that frown.

713
00:42:16,661 --> 00:42:17,883
Of course.

714
00:42:18,300 --> 00:42:19,767
I’ll be totally fine.

715
00:42:20,440 --> 00:42:22,247
What do you mean I won’t be fine?

716
00:42:22,820 --> 00:42:25,585
Don’t let me find out that after I leave,
you cry in your sleep every night.

717
00:42:25,830 --> 00:42:28,647
Oh, that’s nonsense.

718
00:42:29,410 --> 00:42:30,858
I’m a grown-ass man.

719
00:42:30,872 --> 00:42:32,298
I won’t cry.

720
00:42:34,220 --> 00:42:34,923
Look.

721
00:42:35,534 --> 00:42:37,530
Even if I don’t have you to hug while I sleep,

722
00:42:37,563 --> 00:42:39,530
I’ll have your shirt to wear.

723
00:42:40,690 --> 00:42:41,956
Let me keep it.

724
00:42:42,830 --> 00:42:43,658
And this too.

725
00:42:43,665 --> 00:42:44,821
Whenever I cry,

726
00:42:44,858 --> 00:42:47,541
I can use your handkerchief to wipe my tears.

727
00:42:48,290 --> 00:42:50,058
I’m so ready to be alone.

728
00:42:58,900 --> 00:43:01,869
While I’m away, I’ll miss you so much.

729
00:43:03,300 --> 00:43:04,414
Miss me?

730
00:43:04,465 --> 00:43:05,352
You’ll only be gone for a while.

731
00:43:05,381 --> 00:43:06,749
You’ll be back in no time.

732
00:43:08,740 --> 00:43:09,920
By the way, Arc,

733
00:43:11,520 --> 00:43:13,170
did Yotha get into a fight again?

734
00:43:13,730 --> 00:43:14,465
Yes.

735
00:43:15,220 --> 00:43:16,465
About the same old thing.

736
00:43:17,620 --> 00:43:19,825
Can we report it to the police?

737
00:43:20,080 --> 00:43:21,607
So it’ll be over already.

738
00:43:23,230 --> 00:43:24,130
No.

739
00:43:24,770 --> 00:43:27,316
It’ll only be over when Yotha stops.

740
00:43:30,160 --> 00:43:32,160
Is there anything we can do?

741
00:43:32,429 --> 00:43:34,160
I’m worried about them.

742
00:43:34,480 --> 00:43:35,920
Both Yotha and Gun.

743
00:43:39,000 --> 00:43:40,843
I don’t think we should do anything now.

744
00:43:40,872 --> 00:43:41,941
Let it be.

745
00:43:42,589 --> 00:43:44,580
Things will get better in time.

746
00:44:08,940 --> 00:44:09,607
Hey.

747
00:44:09,636 --> 00:44:10,589
You’re back.

748
00:44:19,250 --> 00:44:20,145
Just sleep.

749
00:44:20,196 --> 00:44:21,076
I’ll see who it is.

750
00:44:24,000 --> 00:44:25,992
Who allowed you to move Gun downstairs?

751
00:44:26,036 --> 00:44:27,978
I swapped rooms with Gun in the first place.

752
00:44:28,021 --> 00:44:29,970
Now I want Kong to stay upstairs instead.

753
00:44:29,992 --> 00:44:30,749
What is it to you?

754
00:44:31,790 --> 00:44:34,509
Hey, take it easy.

755
00:44:35,220 --> 00:44:35,978
Don’t fight.

756
00:44:36,000 --> 00:44:36,603
Hey.

757
00:44:37,360 --> 00:44:38,916
Gun is a person, not an object.

758
00:44:39,550 --> 00:44:41,803
You can’t just move him around.

759
00:44:41,840 --> 00:44:43,163
I asked him to.

760
00:44:43,214 --> 00:44:44,392
Quiet, dog.

761
00:44:46,567 --> 00:44:48,261
I made Gun switch rooms

762
00:44:48,290 --> 00:44:49,483
because I thought by sharing a room with you,

763
00:44:49,520 --> 00:44:51,912
he’d get to sleep with the lights on and be taken care of,

764
00:44:51,949 --> 00:44:53,192
but that’s not what happened.

765
00:44:53,229 --> 00:44:54,363
Why are you making this your business?

766
00:44:54,980 --> 00:44:56,654
Don’t think I don’t know

767
00:44:56,974 --> 00:44:59,672
you’ve left Gun to deal with nightmares for many nights.

768
00:44:59,700 --> 00:45:00,720
Not to mention last night.

769
00:45:01,010 --> 00:45:03,221
My friend is not safe with you.

770
00:45:03,260 --> 00:45:04,232
Have you asked me

771
00:45:04,640 --> 00:45:07,003
if I want anyone other than me to take care of Gun?

772
00:45:07,040 --> 00:45:09,665
You’ve never even taken care of him, Yotha.

773
00:45:11,112 --> 00:45:13,040
And what do you mean by saying that?

774
00:45:13,076 --> 00:45:14,298
Are you possessive of him?

775
00:45:15,100 --> 00:45:16,378
What are you to him?

776
00:45:24,160 --> 00:45:25,025
Beagle.

777
00:45:25,774 --> 00:45:26,778
Let’s go back to our room.

778
00:45:32,060 --> 00:45:33,774
I want to stay here with Faifa.

779
00:45:37,860 --> 00:45:38,850
Hey.

780
00:45:39,650 --> 00:45:40,938
Tell the truth.

781
00:45:45,076 --> 00:45:45,694
Beagle.

782
00:45:50,120 --> 00:45:51,360
I’m telling the truth.

783
00:45:53,272 --> 00:45:54,378
I’ll stay here.

784
00:46:05,300 --> 00:46:06,029
Okay.

785
00:46:34,778 --> 00:46:36,923
You really love him so much, Gun.

786
00:46:37,440 --> 00:46:38,378
Damn.

787
00:46:40,000 --> 00:46:41,956
It’s okay.

788
00:46:41,992 --> 00:46:43,090
Don’t cry.

789
00:46:43,352 --> 00:46:44,770
Don’t cry.

790
00:46:57,360 --> 00:46:58,152
- Arc.
- Arm.

791
00:47:02,430 --> 00:47:03,563
You go first.

792
00:47:05,750 --> 00:47:06,989
Can I hug you?

793
00:47:19,580 --> 00:47:23,854
If there’s anything while I’m away, you have to tell me.

794
00:47:23,883 --> 00:47:26,967
Whether it’s about work, personal stuff,

795
00:47:27,470 --> 00:47:28,923
or anything at all.

796
00:47:29,500 --> 00:47:31,898
Don’t think I won’t have time for you while I’m interning.

797
00:47:32,950 --> 00:47:34,661
I’ll always have time for you, you know?

798
00:47:36,660 --> 00:47:38,116
Yes.

799
00:47:38,160 --> 00:47:41,345
I know you love me so much.

800
00:47:43,210 --> 00:47:44,341
Do you love me?

801
00:47:45,040 --> 00:47:47,243
I love you so much too.

802
00:47:54,967 --> 00:47:55,694
Oh!

803
00:47:56,050 --> 00:47:58,538
My cheek is probably bruised now.

804
00:48:02,530 --> 00:48:03,221
Arc!

805
00:48:04,363 --> 00:48:05,200
Arc!

806
00:48:14,676 --> 00:48:16,670
Can I turn the lights off?

807
00:48:29,220 --> 00:48:30,196
Go to sleep.

808
00:48:32,190 --> 00:48:33,767
Good night, Yotha.

809
00:49:01,934 --> 00:49:03,221
Yotha?

810
00:49:04,660 --> 00:49:05,810
Go back to sleep.

811
00:49:06,650 --> 00:49:08,058
You’re just dreaming.

812
00:49:10,490 --> 00:49:13,403
Having a good dream is actually bad like you said.

813
00:49:15,120 --> 00:49:15,949
Why?

814
00:49:17,860 --> 00:49:20,116
Because when I wake up, I won’t see you.

815
00:49:29,250 --> 00:49:30,996
I won’t let you go anywhere.

816
00:49:32,240 --> 00:49:33,367
Do you mean it?

817
00:50:18,200 --> 00:50:19,418
That seat is available.

818
00:50:19,432 --> 00:50:20,560
Go sit there.

819
00:50:52,610 --> 00:50:53,781
Po, you’re definitely getting an F.

820
00:50:53,825 --> 00:50:54,589
Arm.

821
00:50:54,930 --> 00:50:57,258
Hey, what’s up?

822
00:50:57,294 --> 00:50:57,985
Whoa.

823
00:50:58,000 --> 00:51:00,552
While Arc’s away, he sent a bodyguard to take care of you?

824
00:51:00,589 --> 00:51:02,550
So extra.

825
00:51:02,581 --> 00:51:03,010
Right?

826
00:51:03,040 --> 00:51:03,861
Shut up.

827
00:51:03,898 --> 00:51:04,967
He’s my peer mentee.

828
00:51:05,003 --> 00:51:06,218
This is Yotha.

829
00:51:07,300 --> 00:51:08,349
You came all the way here.

830
00:51:08,378 --> 00:51:09,730
Is something the matter?

831
00:51:09,781 --> 00:51:10,574
Well,

832
00:51:12,421 --> 00:51:13,730
do you want to get something to eat together?

833
00:51:21,890 --> 00:51:23,905
You’re almost done with your food.

834
00:51:24,640 --> 00:51:26,254
Hurry up and say what you want.

835
00:51:28,360 --> 00:51:29,534
You know?

836
00:51:31,585 --> 00:51:35,978
You’re probably not just here to eat with me, are you?

837
00:51:37,340 --> 00:51:38,392
Come on.

838
00:51:38,920 --> 00:51:41,578
You can talk to me about anything.

839
00:51:42,280 --> 00:51:43,069
What’s up?

840
00:51:45,540 --> 00:51:47,927
You heard about what happened
at Newton’s bar the other night, right?

841
00:51:49,470 --> 00:51:50,618
Mm.

842
00:51:54,290 --> 00:51:58,000
Since that day, no one has let me near Gun.

843
00:51:58,670 --> 00:52:00,567
Not even my own brother, Fai.

844
00:52:01,570 --> 00:52:03,076
He took Gun away.

845
00:52:05,070 --> 00:52:06,160
Is it that bad?

846
00:52:07,540 --> 00:52:09,243
I don’t know what to do.

847
00:52:11,580 --> 00:52:14,378
What do you mean by that?

848
00:52:15,890 --> 00:52:16,472
Sorry?

849
00:52:17,440 --> 00:52:19,629
I mean, what do you want?

850
00:52:20,060 --> 00:52:23,556
Do you just want your old roommate back?

851
00:52:25,410 --> 00:52:26,036
Yes.

852
00:52:29,450 --> 00:52:30,603
Forget it.

853
00:52:31,060 --> 00:52:33,570
In just one semester,
you’ll be moving out of the on-campus dorm.

854
00:52:33,949 --> 00:52:36,167
Living with a new roommate is a good thing.

855
00:52:36,589 --> 00:52:37,869
You won’t have any problems.

856
00:52:42,500 --> 00:52:45,752
Or do you want Gun back?

857
00:52:55,410 --> 00:52:56,356
So?

858
00:52:59,300 --> 00:53:00,632
I want Gun back.

859
00:53:03,870 --> 00:53:05,127
There you go.

860
00:53:05,345 --> 00:53:06,669
I’ll help you.

861
00:53:15,340 --> 00:53:16,625
Are you sure this will work?

862
00:53:17,340 --> 00:53:19,745
Hey, trust me.

863
00:53:19,774 --> 00:53:21,250
I’m a pro.

864
00:53:21,592 --> 00:53:22,101
There he is.

865
00:53:38,283 --> 00:53:40,363
If I were a snake,
he’d get bitten to death already.

866
00:53:55,620 --> 00:53:56,778
Are you okay, Arm?

867
00:53:56,981 --> 00:53:58,443
Gun.

868
00:53:58,487 --> 00:53:59,200
What’s wrong?

869
00:54:00,820 --> 00:54:02,996
I miss Arc.

870
00:54:03,630 --> 00:54:04,996
Did he leave for his internship already?

871
00:54:05,047 --> 00:54:06,072
Yes.

872
00:54:06,960 --> 00:54:07,549
When did he leave?

873
00:54:07,585 --> 00:54:08,480
This morning.

874
00:54:08,836 --> 00:54:09,956
Huh? Just this morning?

875
00:54:10,000 --> 00:54:10,843
Yes.

876
00:54:12,510 --> 00:54:15,192
We've always been together so I miss him.

877
00:54:15,214 --> 00:54:17,287
After only half an hour apart, I already miss him.

878
00:54:22,640 --> 00:54:24,094
There, there.

879
00:54:24,247 --> 00:54:26,850
Don’t touch me or I’ll cry harder.

880
00:54:29,790 --> 00:54:31,592
I have an idea.

881
00:54:31,636 --> 00:54:32,349
Hmm?

882
00:54:32,378 --> 00:54:33,476
It’s just Rayong.

883
00:54:33,549 --> 00:54:35,774
You could drive there to see him this weekend.

884
00:54:35,810 --> 00:54:36,734
No.

885
00:54:36,778 --> 00:54:40,610
Arc won’t let me drive there alone.

886
00:54:41,130 --> 00:54:42,334
Maybe you can ask your friends to go with you.

887
00:54:42,356 --> 00:54:44,000
I don’t have any friends, Gun.

888
00:54:44,043 --> 00:54:45,490
I don’t have any friends.

889
00:54:45,527 --> 00:54:46,596
You don’t have friends?

890
00:54:49,600 --> 00:54:51,105
Don’t touch me.

891
00:54:52,960 --> 00:54:55,585
Are you free?

892
00:54:56,130 --> 00:54:57,570
Can you go with me?

893
00:54:58,500 --> 00:54:59,149
Me?

894
00:55:01,030 --> 00:55:02,952
I heard you’ve been stressed out lately.

895
00:55:02,974 --> 00:55:05,730
A relaxing one-night trip to the beach will do you good.

896
00:55:06,420 --> 00:55:07,098
Are you sure that’s a good idea?

897
00:55:07,134 --> 00:55:08,283
Of course.

898
00:55:08,320 --> 00:55:09,658
Don’t worry about the accommodation.

899
00:55:09,694 --> 00:55:11,054
I’ll take care of it.

900
00:55:15,090 --> 00:55:17,032
No one loves me.

901
00:55:18,960 --> 00:55:20,378
Okay.

902
00:55:20,414 --> 00:55:21,512
I’m free.

903
00:55:27,870 --> 00:55:28,821
What’s in your eye?

904
00:55:28,850 --> 00:55:29,825
Oh, it’s nothing.

905
00:55:29,869 --> 00:55:31,156
Just dust.

906
00:55:33,060 --> 00:55:34,501
Oh, hi, Yotha.

907
00:55:34,523 --> 00:55:35,360
Hi.

908
00:55:35,389 --> 00:55:36,661
Are you done with classes?

909
00:55:36,698 --> 00:55:37,556
Yes.

910
00:55:37,585 --> 00:55:38,545
Ah.

911
00:55:38,610 --> 00:55:42,458
Gun and I were just planning to go to Rayong.

912
00:55:42,487 --> 00:55:43,985
Do you want to join us?

913
00:55:44,494 --> 00:55:45,520
Arm!

914
00:55:46,750 --> 00:55:49,534
Do you remember our group bracelets?

915
00:55:49,570 --> 00:55:51,530
Tawan is out of the forest now.

916
00:55:51,570 --> 00:55:52,880
He happens to be in Rayong.

917
00:55:52,916 --> 00:55:55,149
We can go there and get your bracelets.

918
00:55:55,178 --> 00:55:56,080
Okay.

919
00:55:56,574 --> 00:55:57,600
I also happen to be free.

920
00:55:57,658 --> 00:56:01,549
If Yotha’s joining you,
can I not go?

921
00:56:01,570 --> 00:56:02,109
Okay.

922
00:56:02,130 --> 00:56:03,789
I’ll sort out the accommodation for both of you.

923
00:56:03,818 --> 00:56:05,301
See you this Saturday at 8 a.m.
in front of the on-campus dorm.

924
00:56:05,338 --> 00:56:06,618
I’ll drive smoothly.

925
00:56:17,420 --> 00:56:19,592
I’m picking up Yotha and Gun now.

926
00:56:19,629 --> 00:56:21,214
See you in 3 hours.

927
00:56:26,750 --> 00:56:28,370
I can drive.

928
00:56:32,880 --> 00:56:33,461
Here.

929
00:56:33,767 --> 00:56:34,465
Thanks.

930
00:56:41,854 --> 00:56:42,632
Ouch!

931
00:56:45,978 --> 00:56:47,163
Arm is cute, isn’t he?

932
00:56:47,790 --> 00:56:48,720
Are you talking to me?

933
00:56:53,900 --> 00:56:54,858
I’m talking to myself.

934
00:57:24,458 --> 00:57:26,996
I’ve missed my boyfriend so much!

935
00:57:28,720 --> 00:57:30,232
Why do you love me so much?

936
00:57:35,310 --> 00:57:36,101
How are you?

937
00:57:36,130 --> 00:57:36,880
Good.

938
00:57:37,940 --> 00:57:38,589
Hey, guys.

939
00:57:38,618 --> 00:57:38,981
Hi.

940
00:57:39,025 --> 00:57:39,970
Hi.

941
00:57:42,630 --> 00:57:43,061
Here you go.

942
00:57:43,090 --> 00:57:43,869
Thank you.

943
00:57:43,905 --> 00:57:45,156
Settle in.

944
00:57:45,185 --> 00:57:46,712
We’ll go see Tawan in the evening.

945
00:57:46,741 --> 00:57:47,476
Okay.

946
00:57:47,830 --> 00:57:48,385
We’re off.

947
00:57:48,414 --> 00:57:49,069
Let’s go.

948
00:58:06,770 --> 00:58:07,738
Shall we go?

949
00:58:40,130 --> 00:58:41,767
Are you really not going to talk to me?

950
00:58:56,190 --> 00:58:57,585
What do you want me to talk about?

951
00:58:59,110 --> 00:59:00,174
You’re not the same.

952
00:59:02,170 --> 00:59:03,367
How am I not the same?

953
00:59:17,860 --> 00:59:19,316
Hey, Yotha!

954
00:59:19,345 --> 00:59:20,363
I’m not playing!

955
00:59:20,407 --> 00:59:21,527
What are you doing?

956
00:59:21,556 --> 00:59:22,480
Beagle.

957
00:59:26,480 --> 00:59:27,345
I’m sorry.

958
00:59:30,370 --> 00:59:32,174
I’m sorry for everything.

959
00:59:34,516 --> 00:59:36,170
Can you tie my tie again?

960
00:59:38,560 --> 00:59:39,483
Yotha.

961
01:00:02,792 --> 01:00:04,530
I’m going to walk on the beach.

962
01:00:26,170 --> 01:00:27,323
You…

963
01:00:31,090 --> 01:00:32,720
Want to walk with me?

964
01:00:43,090 --> 01:00:43,847
Yes.

965
01:00:44,530 --> 01:00:49,920
♪ It’s you, only you, who teaches me love ♪

966
01:00:49,949 --> 01:00:56,254
♪ It’s you, only you, who makes me see ♪

967
01:00:56,283 --> 01:00:58,734
♪ What true love is like  ♪

968
01:00:58,770 --> 01:01:02,821
♪ I want you to forever stay by my side  ♪

969
01:01:04,360 --> 01:01:05,687
You remember me?

970
01:01:05,723 --> 01:01:06,705
Of course.

971
01:01:07,210 --> 01:01:07,898
Why?

972
01:01:07,920 --> 01:01:09,069
Are you happy that I remember you?

973
01:01:09,098 --> 01:01:09,687
Yes.

974
01:01:09,723 --> 01:01:10,930
Which one of you is in Perfect 10 Liners?

975
01:01:10,974 --> 01:01:11,650
Me.

976
01:01:11,920 --> 01:01:12,989
Do you have a partner to wear these with?

977
01:01:14,640 --> 01:01:17,316
The sunrise at the beach is beautiful.

978
01:01:18,130 --> 01:01:18,872
Beagle.

979
01:01:18,887 --> 01:01:20,145
You’ll wait for me, right?

980
01:01:20,283 --> 01:01:20,967
Mm.

981
01:01:21,270 --> 01:01:21,927
I’ll wait.

982
01:01:23,360 --> 01:01:25,025
What if the answer turns out to be no?

983
01:01:25,050 --> 01:01:26,312
Will you be sad?

984
01:01:26,356 --> 01:01:27,040
No,

985
01:01:28,040 --> 01:01:30,320
because I’m the sunshine of this world.
