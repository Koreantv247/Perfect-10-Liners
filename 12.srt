1
00:00:00,140 --> 00:00:00,700
How’s it going?

2
00:00:00,920 --> 00:00:02,200
Have you gotten any closer to Yotha?

3
00:00:02,450 --> 00:00:03,690
I’m closer to him now.

4
00:00:03,890 --> 00:00:05,400
I’ve been upgraded to your best friend?

5
00:00:10,860 --> 00:00:13,960
You just smiled widely for the first time
since we’ve known each other.

6
00:00:14,200 --> 00:00:15,210
Can you smile more often?

7
00:00:15,390 --> 00:00:16,280
I like it.

8
00:00:17,600 --> 00:00:19,120
If you trip in the engineering courtyard,

9
00:00:19,230 --> 00:00:20,220
you’ll get a partner from Engineering.

10
00:00:20,300 --> 00:00:20,990
What a bummer.

11
00:00:21,120 --> 00:00:22,200
I wish this was the courtyard.

12
00:00:22,410 --> 00:00:24,000
Someone said you brought a guy to your room.

13
00:00:24,180 --> 00:00:26,290
So how’s sharing a room with Yotha?

14
00:00:26,490 --> 00:00:27,680
Sometimes, Yotha talks a lot.

15
00:00:27,780 --> 00:00:28,340
Really?

16
00:00:31,620 --> 00:00:32,870
You said you wouldn’t drink late tonight.

17
00:00:38,570 --> 00:00:39,860
Yotha brought his friend,

18
00:00:40,370 --> 00:00:41,520
so I stayed and talked a bit.

19
00:00:49,020 --> 00:00:49,950
What are you up to this time?

20
00:00:50,920 --> 00:00:51,450
Klao.

21
00:00:52,630 --> 00:00:53,800
He hasn’t done anything.

22
00:00:55,300 --> 00:00:56,110
Look at his face.

23
00:00:57,560 --> 00:00:58,640
He can’t be trusted.

24
00:01:02,730 --> 00:01:03,200
Let’s go.

25
00:01:13,280 --> 00:01:13,800
Klao.

26
00:03:14,380 --> 00:03:15,250
Did you go out to eat congee?

27
00:03:16,080 --> 00:03:16,570
Yes.

28
00:03:26,880 --> 00:03:30,010
YOTHA THANAWANYOTHA - WENT TO EAT CONGEE
GUNYUKHOL	JIRAROJ - WENT TO EAT CONGEE

29
00:03:36,760 --> 00:03:39,890
YOTHA THANAWANYOTHA - WENT TO EAT CONGEE
GUNYUKHOL	JIRAROJ - WENT TO EAT CONGEE

30
00:03:54,920 --> 00:03:55,500
Wa.

31
00:03:56,620 --> 00:03:57,140
Wa.

32
00:03:58,930 --> 00:03:59,440
Wa!

33
00:04:00,380 --> 00:04:01,310
Let’s talk!

34
00:04:01,600 --> 00:04:03,340
Get it together, then we can talk.

35
00:04:03,360 --> 00:04:04,300
We’re talking now!

36
00:04:05,750 --> 00:04:08,300
Klao, I don’t like when you’re like this.

37
00:04:08,870 --> 00:04:09,790
You mean

38
00:04:10,440 --> 00:04:11,970
when I interrupted your conversation with him?

39
00:04:12,390 --> 00:04:14,240
Don’t forget what you just said.

40
00:04:15,730 --> 00:04:16,730
When you calm down,

41
00:04:17,390 --> 00:04:23,500
reflect on what you said and how much it hurt me.

42
00:05:15,580 --> 00:05:16,810
Don’t you have anything to ask me tonight?

43
00:05:17,570 --> 00:05:18,640
You can read my mind?

44
00:05:19,560 --> 00:05:21,200
Or do you just know I’m nosy?

45
00:05:22,360 --> 00:05:23,470
More like the latter.

46
00:05:23,980 --> 00:05:25,620
Watch it, Yotha!

47
00:05:29,530 --> 00:05:30,900
I really don’t have anything
to ask tonight, though.

48
00:05:32,730 --> 00:05:33,600
I’ll take a shower then.

49
00:05:41,390 --> 00:05:41,900
What?

50
00:05:42,760 --> 00:05:43,800
You said you’d take me to your house.

51
00:05:44,000 --> 00:05:44,650
Don’t forget it.

52
00:05:46,920 --> 00:05:48,500
Alright, I won’t.

53
00:06:01,160 --> 00:06:02,190
Stop!

54
00:06:04,230 --> 00:06:05,300
What do you want with my head?

55
00:06:07,590 --> 00:06:08,610
Your hair is soft,

56
00:06:11,480 --> 00:06:12,200
just like a dog’s fur.

57
00:06:13,490 --> 00:06:13,980
Hey.

58
00:06:16,110 --> 00:06:16,800
You’re just…

59
00:06:17,670 --> 00:06:20,050
I hope you slip on the bathroom floor.

60
00:06:21,920 --> 00:06:23,020
I look so handsome,

61
00:06:23,460 --> 00:06:24,410
but you said I look like a dog.

62
00:08:07,620 --> 00:08:08,790
You toss and turn like a child.

63
00:08:46,650 --> 00:08:47,250
What are you doing?

64
00:08:47,840 --> 00:08:48,740
I’m sitting here posing.

65
00:08:52,310 --> 00:08:53,100
Me too.

66
00:08:53,310 --> 00:08:53,820
Hey.

67
00:08:54,800 --> 00:08:55,570
I’m posing too.

68
00:08:56,280 --> 00:08:57,500
Don’t copy me.

69
00:08:58,990 --> 00:09:00,090
Come on!

70
00:09:07,600 --> 00:09:08,500
Sorry.

71
00:09:09,480 --> 00:09:10,450
I was in a rush this morning,

72
00:09:10,460 --> 00:09:11,430
so I forgot to get your tie ready for you.

73
00:09:33,410 --> 00:09:35,590
Are you joining the Buddy Draw this evening?

74
00:09:36,810 --> 00:09:37,430
Are you?

75
00:09:38,730 --> 00:09:39,510
Hmm…

76
00:09:40,690 --> 00:09:41,220
of course.

77
00:09:42,520 --> 00:09:43,040
Mm.

78
00:09:43,970 --> 00:09:44,700
Then I’m joining too.

79
00:09:46,130 --> 00:09:46,640
Okay.

80
00:09:51,540 --> 00:09:52,100
All done.

81
00:09:52,800 --> 00:09:53,540
See you this evening.

82
00:09:54,260 --> 00:09:55,100
Pay attention in class.

83
00:10:10,780 --> 00:10:11,360
You too.

84
00:10:24,010 --> 00:10:25,160
Pay attention in class.

85
00:10:25,180 --> 00:10:26,730
You too.

86
00:10:26,960 --> 00:10:27,730
You too.

87
00:10:30,440 --> 00:10:31,260
What’s wrong with you guys?

88
00:10:32,520 --> 00:10:33,070
Stop it!

89
00:10:53,080 --> 00:10:53,560
Klao.

90
00:11:00,910 --> 00:11:01,440
Wa.

91
00:11:02,620 --> 00:11:03,640
What are you doing here?

92
00:11:06,470 --> 00:11:07,050
Well,

93
00:11:09,420 --> 00:11:10,460
I came to apologize.

94
00:11:21,520 --> 00:11:22,740
Did you sleep outside all night?

95
00:11:29,520 --> 00:11:30,130
Wa,

96
00:11:33,370 --> 00:11:34,220
about last night,

97
00:11:36,380 --> 00:11:37,180
I’m sorry.

98
00:11:41,550 --> 00:11:42,300
I forgive you.

99
00:11:44,910 --> 00:11:45,400
Oh?

100
00:11:46,670 --> 00:11:49,240
Why forgive me so easily?

101
00:11:53,670 --> 00:11:54,610
Because I know

102
00:11:55,230 --> 00:11:56,950
you did that because you love me,

103
00:11:57,830 --> 00:11:58,420
right?

104
00:12:14,640 --> 00:12:15,860
I’m scared of losing you

105
00:12:18,210 --> 00:12:19,110
and...

106
00:12:22,300 --> 00:12:23,620
I’m scared of losing to your first love.

107
00:12:25,600 --> 00:12:26,650
You’re not competing with anyone

108
00:12:27,970 --> 00:12:29,790
and you don’t need to compare yourself to anyone

109
00:12:34,530 --> 00:12:36,100
because you’ve already beaten everyone

110
00:12:36,880 --> 00:12:38,590
the day I chose you, Klao.

111
00:13:16,310 --> 00:13:16,920
Let me help.

112
00:13:17,240 --> 00:13:17,970
Oh, hey, Yotha.

113
00:13:19,430 --> 00:13:20,650
Are all the first-years here?

114
00:13:21,620 --> 00:13:23,040
I haven’t finished setting things up.

115
00:13:23,710 --> 00:13:24,530
I’ll help.

116
00:13:26,560 --> 00:13:27,820
Are these for the Buddy Draw?

117
00:13:28,670 --> 00:13:29,130
Yeah.

118
00:13:30,090 --> 00:13:32,540
If you get the same number,
you pair with each other.

119
00:13:32,560 --> 00:13:33,130
It’s easy.

120
00:13:36,070 --> 00:13:38,510
How many are there in total?

121
00:13:40,050 --> 00:13:41,110
247.

122
00:13:42,050 --> 00:13:42,540
Why?

123
00:13:43,750 --> 00:13:44,290
Nothing.

124
00:13:44,490 --> 00:13:45,350
Do you need my help?

125
00:13:45,870 --> 00:13:46,480
Yeah.

126
00:13:46,970 --> 00:13:48,490
You can write the numbers down.

127
00:13:48,500 --> 00:13:50,100
I’ll put them up.

128
00:13:50,610 --> 00:13:51,100
Okay.

129
00:13:52,860 --> 00:13:54,610
I’ve done about 211 now.

130
00:13:54,670 --> 00:13:56,130
You can do the rest and I’ll put them up.

131
00:13:56,210 --> 00:13:56,740
Sure.

132
00:14:00,710 --> 00:14:02,880
Whoa!

133
00:14:04,590 --> 00:14:05,400
Why are there so many people?

134
00:14:05,410 --> 00:14:07,800
First-years who’ve arrived,
please come to the front.

135
00:14:09,710 --> 00:14:10,710
Hey, Gun.

136
00:14:11,480 --> 00:14:12,010
Hi.

137
00:14:16,130 --> 00:14:17,400
Stop it, Fai!

138
00:14:17,960 --> 00:14:18,780
Fai!

139
00:14:21,090 --> 00:14:21,560
Faifa.

140
00:14:21,790 --> 00:14:22,700
- Huh?
- Let me ask you something.

141
00:14:23,080 --> 00:14:24,800
Doesn’t a social butterfly like you

142
00:14:26,210 --> 00:14:27,530
have any friends in your major?

143
00:14:27,770 --> 00:14:28,300
Yeah.

144
00:14:28,430 --> 00:14:29,540
I could slap your mouth!

145
00:14:30,730 --> 00:14:31,200
He’s right.

146
00:14:31,300 --> 00:14:32,320
You’re always hanging out with us.

147
00:14:33,250 --> 00:14:35,470
Are you being bullied?

148
00:14:37,050 --> 00:14:38,020
Stop it.

149
00:14:38,840 --> 00:14:39,810
I’m telling you,

150
00:14:40,280 --> 00:14:42,720
I’m close to everyone in the Electrical Major.

151
00:14:43,180 --> 00:14:44,720
I hang out with you guys

152
00:14:45,140 --> 00:14:46,470
because I’m on a mission

153
00:14:47,050 --> 00:14:48,570
to get close to everyone in the Chemical Major.

154
00:14:49,690 --> 00:14:50,240
Whatever.

155
00:14:50,330 --> 00:14:51,380
Let’s hurry and get in line.

156
00:14:51,410 --> 00:14:53,550
- Let’s go.
- Let’s get this over with and go home.

157
00:14:53,590 --> 00:14:54,300
Guys,

158
00:14:54,930 --> 00:14:58,400
do you see about 8 million star trees behind you?

159
00:14:59,610 --> 00:15:03,100
You should go there and grab one star each.

160
00:15:03,650 --> 00:15:05,340
Then find someone who gets
the same number as you.

161
00:15:05,700 --> 00:15:08,400
That person will be
your buddy for the whole year.

162
00:15:09,530 --> 00:15:10,740
If you have no questions,

163
00:15:11,260 --> 00:15:11,900
let’s get started.

164
00:15:17,810 --> 00:15:20,210
Let me pair with anyone except Faifa.

165
00:15:20,380 --> 00:15:21,620
Sadhu.

166
00:15:21,760 --> 00:15:22,290
Why?

167
00:15:22,720 --> 00:15:23,700
What’s wrong with pairing with me?

168
00:15:26,820 --> 00:15:28,770
Should we wait for the crowd to die down

169
00:15:28,990 --> 00:15:29,610
before we go?

170
00:15:30,080 --> 00:15:30,600
Agreed.

171
00:15:30,940 --> 00:15:33,960
If we go now, we’ll get stampeded.

172
00:15:34,410 --> 00:15:35,400
How about we go to the left?

173
00:15:35,620 --> 00:15:36,510
There aren’t many people there.

174
00:15:36,820 --> 00:15:37,980
Let’s hurry, grab one, and come back.

175
00:15:38,030 --> 00:15:39,500
- We’ll need to find our buddy too.
- Why is this so chaotic?

176
00:15:40,560 --> 00:15:41,020
Yeah.

177
00:15:46,030 --> 00:15:46,520
Oh.

178
00:15:47,810 --> 00:15:48,440
Have you drawn your buddy?

179
00:15:48,690 --> 00:15:49,990
No, have you?

180
00:15:50,580 --> 00:15:51,100
Not yet.

181
00:15:51,940 --> 00:15:52,520
Let’s go together.

182
00:15:53,810 --> 00:15:54,200
What?

183
00:15:54,300 --> 00:15:54,990
What?

184
00:15:55,310 --> 00:15:56,690
What about us?

185
00:15:56,710 --> 00:15:57,420
Hey.

186
00:15:57,940 --> 00:15:58,820
Leave them alone.

187
00:15:59,110 --> 00:16:00,000
Let’s go over there.

188
00:16:00,840 --> 00:16:01,530
It’s okay.

189
00:16:13,930 --> 00:16:15,520
Hey, Gun. Hey, Yotha.

190
00:16:15,640 --> 00:16:16,680
- Hi, Arm.
- Hi.

191
00:16:18,130 --> 00:16:18,890
Have you drawn your buddy?

192
00:16:20,260 --> 00:16:21,810
These are all lucky numbers here.

193
00:16:22,790 --> 00:16:23,370
Really?

194
00:16:23,460 --> 00:16:23,900
Yeah.

195
00:16:24,330 --> 00:16:24,860
Love it.

196
00:16:25,360 --> 00:16:26,170
I’ll draw it then.

197
00:16:28,610 --> 00:16:29,750
Reach far.

198
00:16:30,880 --> 00:16:31,760
Reach far?

199
00:16:32,260 --> 00:16:32,840
Which one should I get?

200
00:16:38,590 --> 00:16:39,250
How about this one?

201
00:16:40,150 --> 00:16:41,210
Go with your gut feeling.

202
00:16:41,550 --> 00:16:42,370
- Gut feeling?
- Beagle.

203
00:16:45,770 --> 00:16:47,090
I accidentally grabbed two.

204
00:16:50,460 --> 00:16:51,140
Do you want this one?

205
00:16:52,180 --> 00:16:52,670
Sure.

206
00:16:56,280 --> 00:16:58,590
Can I open it now?

207
00:16:59,180 --> 00:16:59,690
Yeah.

208
00:17:06,580 --> 00:17:07,740
248.

209
00:17:12,270 --> 00:17:12,960
What number did you get?

210
00:17:18,040 --> 00:17:18,520
Hey.

211
00:17:19,540 --> 00:17:20,310
We got the same number.

212
00:17:22,440 --> 00:17:25,360
So this means Yotha and I are buddies, right?

213
00:17:26,700 --> 00:17:27,210
Yeah.

214
00:17:27,730 --> 00:17:28,590
You got the same number,

215
00:17:28,900 --> 00:17:29,700
so you pair with each other.

216
00:17:31,840 --> 00:17:32,390
Cool.

217
00:17:34,800 --> 00:17:35,290
Great.

218
00:17:36,580 --> 00:17:38,500
Shall we get to know each other,

219
00:17:38,840 --> 00:17:39,500
Buddy?

220
00:17:42,550 --> 00:17:43,380
We already know each other.

221
00:17:44,380 --> 00:17:45,110
No.

222
00:17:45,920 --> 00:17:46,390
Come on.

223
00:17:46,410 --> 00:17:47,010
Give me your hand.

224
00:17:52,840 --> 00:17:53,300
I’m Gun.

225
00:17:54,280 --> 00:17:55,180
Chemical Major.

226
00:17:56,700 --> 00:17:57,360
Yotha.

227
00:17:58,010 --> 00:17:58,670
Yotha.

228
00:18:00,090 --> 00:18:01,510
Why did you say Yotha twice?

229
00:18:04,970 --> 00:18:05,770
You’re getting on my nerves.

230
00:18:09,160 --> 00:18:09,900
This is great.

231
00:18:10,670 --> 00:18:11,950
You won’t have to feel uncomfortable

232
00:18:12,610 --> 00:18:14,800
or try to get to know other people.

233
00:18:16,290 --> 00:18:19,130
I’ll take care of you this year.

234
00:18:20,440 --> 00:18:20,960
Mm.

235
00:18:23,370 --> 00:18:24,260
What a coincidence.

236
00:18:25,130 --> 00:18:25,860
It’s unbelievable.

237
00:18:28,150 --> 00:18:28,860
Hey.

238
00:18:30,350 --> 00:18:31,700
Now that you’re buddies, go.

239
00:18:32,360 --> 00:18:33,400
Take care of each other well.

240
00:18:33,930 --> 00:18:35,000
We will.

241
00:18:35,500 --> 00:18:37,000
What a coincidence, right, Yotha?

242
00:18:47,330 --> 00:18:48,180
They remind me of myself.

243
00:18:49,520 --> 00:18:50,920
I’m back.

244
00:18:52,840 --> 00:18:53,340
Oh.

245
00:18:57,200 --> 00:18:58,500
Arc, where are you?

246
00:18:59,930 --> 00:19:00,740
Hello?

247
00:19:02,120 --> 00:19:02,820
Arc?

248
00:19:06,160 --> 00:19:06,770
I’m here.

249
00:19:07,840 --> 00:19:08,300
Oh.

250
00:19:09,240 --> 00:19:10,100
I’m back.

251
00:19:21,070 --> 00:19:21,860
Where are you taking that?

252
00:19:23,420 --> 00:19:24,180
I’m putting it away.

253
00:19:25,990 --> 00:19:27,770
But what will I wear to class?

254
00:19:28,070 --> 00:19:31,000
While I’m away on my internship,

255
00:19:31,370 --> 00:19:33,300
you can only wear my jacket.

256
00:19:33,550 --> 00:19:34,120
Why?

257
00:19:36,320 --> 00:19:38,570
So people know you’re taken.

258
00:19:42,900 --> 00:19:43,910
So possessive.

259
00:19:46,770 --> 00:19:48,710
My boyfriend is this cute.

260
00:19:50,060 --> 00:19:51,200
Let me be possessive.

261
00:19:58,080 --> 00:19:59,580
Kitten.

262
00:20:09,100 --> 00:20:09,610
Huh?

263
00:20:15,060 --> 00:20:15,800
Why are you guys shocked?

264
00:20:16,880 --> 00:20:17,830
There were hundreds of people

265
00:20:18,120 --> 00:20:19,400
and you got Yotha?

266
00:20:23,010 --> 00:20:23,870
God must have seen

267
00:20:24,460 --> 00:20:26,720
that Yotha really can’t
get along with anyone else

268
00:20:27,080 --> 00:20:27,780
except me.

269
00:20:28,350 --> 00:20:30,790
You mean it’s destiny?

270
00:20:31,260 --> 00:20:31,900
No, that’s crazy.

271
00:20:36,660 --> 00:20:37,440
This is weird.

272
00:20:38,340 --> 00:20:38,950
Weird how?

273
00:20:39,270 --> 00:20:40,730
Since you started talking about Yotha,

274
00:20:41,450 --> 00:20:42,700
you haven’t stopped smiling.

275
00:20:46,530 --> 00:20:47,120
I’m not smiling.

276
00:20:47,370 --> 00:20:47,990
You are.

277
00:20:48,880 --> 00:20:49,500
I’m not smiling.

278
00:20:49,610 --> 00:20:50,100
You are!

279
00:20:57,490 --> 00:20:58,360
Don’t tell us

280
00:21:02,750 --> 00:21:03,690
That you

281
00:21:06,520 --> 00:21:07,730
Like Yotha!

282
00:21:11,390 --> 00:21:11,990
Shit!

283
00:21:12,970 --> 00:21:13,910
How did you get in?

284
00:21:14,520 --> 00:21:15,140
The door wasn’t locked.

285
00:21:15,190 --> 00:21:16,790
But why did you come in?

286
00:21:26,170 --> 00:21:27,420
I forgot the key in my room,

287
00:21:28,100 --> 00:21:29,100
so I’ve been waiting for Yotha to come.

288
00:21:35,250 --> 00:21:37,130
I have to go.

289
00:21:38,700 --> 00:21:39,300
See you.

290
00:21:48,410 --> 00:21:50,370
If Gun really likes Yotha,

291
00:21:51,420 --> 00:21:52,270
what do we do?

292
00:21:54,990 --> 00:21:56,890
What does that mean?

293
00:22:50,350 --> 00:22:50,980
What are you doing?

294
00:22:52,960 --> 00:22:53,920
Putting your key in your bag.

295
00:22:55,050 --> 00:22:58,360
So Beagle with a goldfish memory
like you won’t forget it again.

296
00:23:00,370 --> 00:23:01,610
So I’m not only a dog,

297
00:23:02,000 --> 00:23:03,050
but a fish too?

298
00:23:05,350 --> 00:23:06,340
You’re everything.

299
00:23:11,020 --> 00:23:13,520
This Buddy takes really good care of me.

300
00:23:28,810 --> 00:23:30,260
(Since you started talking about Yotha,)

301
00:23:31,160 --> 00:23:32,340
you haven’t stopped smiling.

302
00:23:33,890 --> 00:23:34,760
Don’t tell us

303
00:23:35,130 --> 00:23:35,940
That you

304
00:23:36,650 --> 00:23:37,810
(Like Yotha!)

305
00:23:49,170 --> 00:23:50,200
I’m thirsty.

306
00:23:51,410 --> 00:23:52,040
For milk.

307
00:23:54,120 --> 00:23:54,700
I want some milk.

308
00:24:10,700 --> 00:24:11,170
Here.

309
00:24:13,270 --> 00:24:13,930
A treat for my buddy.

310
00:24:14,610 --> 00:24:15,080
Hmm?

311
00:24:22,770 --> 00:24:23,500
Let me put the straw in for you.

312
00:24:28,910 --> 00:24:29,410
Drink it.

313
00:24:39,500 --> 00:24:40,070
Is it good?

314
00:24:40,410 --> 00:24:40,900
Mm.

315
00:24:41,630 --> 00:24:43,900
If you want more, feel free to grab more.

316
00:24:44,450 --> 00:24:45,180
I’m happy to share.

317
00:24:50,120 --> 00:24:51,100
But I want you to grab it for me.

318
00:24:55,380 --> 00:24:56,150
Don’t you have hands?

319
00:24:57,930 --> 00:24:58,400
I do.

320
00:25:00,300 --> 00:25:01,240
But I have you too.

321
00:25:11,730 --> 00:25:12,230
I’m done.

322
00:25:14,620 --> 00:25:15,150
I’m sleepy.

323
00:25:17,760 --> 00:25:18,400
Are you going to sleep now?

324
00:25:28,500 --> 00:25:29,500
(Don’t tell us)

325
00:25:29,990 --> 00:25:30,810
(That you)

326
00:25:31,190 --> 00:25:32,360
Like Yotha!

327
00:25:34,780 --> 00:25:35,830
Don’t be delusional, Gun!

328
00:26:01,950 --> 00:26:02,660
Is something wrong?

329
00:26:06,450 --> 00:26:07,380
No, I’m fine.

330
00:26:14,970 --> 00:26:15,770
I said I’m fine.

331
00:26:24,890 --> 00:26:25,510
Yotha.

332
00:26:26,560 --> 00:26:27,140
What?

333
00:26:28,580 --> 00:26:29,450
(So did Yotha.)

334
00:26:30,220 --> 00:26:31,640
He got traumatized when he was a kid too.

335
00:26:32,100 --> 00:26:32,730
Really?

336
00:26:33,370 --> 00:26:34,980
Yotha never told me that.

337
00:26:35,010 --> 00:26:36,180
Something traumatized him

338
00:26:36,870 --> 00:26:38,200
and it made him scared of love.

339
00:26:40,500 --> 00:26:44,650
Newton said you’re scared of love.

340
00:26:46,550 --> 00:26:47,170
Is that true?

341
00:26:50,190 --> 00:26:51,150
Why would you believe a drunk person?

342
00:26:52,060 --> 00:26:53,000
I’m not scared of it.

343
00:26:53,670 --> 00:26:55,890
I just don’t believe in it or have faith in it.

344
00:26:57,380 --> 00:26:59,290
Just like how you never think about
trying to sleep with the lights off

345
00:27:00,700 --> 00:27:03,330
because you’re convinced you’ll have to
sleep with them on for the rest of your life.

346
00:27:04,220 --> 00:27:04,980
It’s the same.

347
00:27:12,230 --> 00:27:16,510
But have you ever thought that

348
00:27:17,360 --> 00:27:19,270
one day someone might
make you believe in it again?

349
00:27:19,280 --> 00:27:19,790
No.

350
00:27:27,700 --> 00:27:28,370
Not at all?

351
00:27:33,420 --> 00:27:34,370
How about we compete?

352
00:27:35,250 --> 00:27:35,800
Compete?

353
00:27:36,370 --> 00:27:36,890
Mm.

354
00:27:37,730 --> 00:27:39,830
Whoever overcomes their fear first wins.

355
00:27:41,060 --> 00:27:41,610
For what?

356
00:27:44,170 --> 00:27:48,140
So you can love

357
00:27:48,710 --> 00:27:50,600
and I can live life more easily,

358
00:27:52,830 --> 00:27:53,640
plus, save electricity.

359
00:27:58,570 --> 00:28:00,530
But why do you want me to love again?

360
00:28:08,220 --> 00:28:09,630
It’s not like that.

361
00:28:10,860 --> 00:28:12,200
You’re scared of love.

362
00:28:13,080 --> 00:28:14,140
I’m scared of the dark.

363
00:28:14,680 --> 00:28:15,860
We both have traumas.

364
00:28:20,460 --> 00:28:21,140
That’s all?

365
00:28:24,060 --> 00:28:24,650
Mm.

366
00:28:35,460 --> 00:28:36,000
Okay.

367
00:28:37,530 --> 00:28:40,260
Why did you move your face close to mine?

368
00:28:40,440 --> 00:28:42,600
But once I can love again,

369
00:28:43,950 --> 00:28:45,700
you must take responsibility for my feelings.

370
00:28:47,770 --> 00:28:48,690
What does that have to do with me?

371
00:28:56,940 --> 00:28:57,490
Deal.

372
00:28:58,590 --> 00:29:03,710
♪ It’s you, only you, who teaches me love ♪

373
00:29:03,980 --> 00:29:09,960
♪ It’s you, only you, who makes me see ♪

374
00:29:10,230 --> 00:29:12,500
♪ What true love is like  ♪

375
00:29:12,940 --> 00:29:17,290
♪ I want you to forever stay by my side  ♪

376
00:29:17,570 --> 00:29:18,100
Hey.

377
00:29:24,930 --> 00:29:25,390
Hey.

378
00:29:26,910 --> 00:29:27,420
Gun.

379
00:29:30,000 --> 00:29:30,490
Hey!

380
00:29:31,690 --> 00:29:32,630
Fai, you startled me.

381
00:29:32,920 --> 00:29:33,410
What is it?

382
00:29:33,480 --> 00:29:35,240
What’s wrong with you, Gun?

383
00:29:37,310 --> 00:29:38,300
You won’t answer any of our questions.

384
00:29:39,570 --> 00:29:40,400
Or maybe…

385
00:29:40,420 --> 00:29:40,900
Hey.

386
00:29:41,140 --> 00:29:42,160
Nothing is going on.

387
00:29:43,220 --> 00:29:45,090
Last night I went back to my room

388
00:29:45,110 --> 00:29:47,150
and Yotha came back…

389
00:29:47,180 --> 00:29:49,090
And we took a shower.

390
00:29:50,640 --> 00:29:51,650
We took separate showers.

391
00:29:51,670 --> 00:29:52,980
Then I fell asleep first.

392
00:29:53,030 --> 00:29:56,620
There was nothing suspicious
between Yotha and me.

393
00:29:56,630 --> 00:29:58,820
Oh.

394
00:29:59,690 --> 00:30:02,200
It’s obvious, Kong.

395
00:30:02,980 --> 00:30:03,920
We don’t need a lie detector

396
00:30:04,720 --> 00:30:06,230
because the lie is already out.

397
00:30:07,450 --> 00:30:08,390
Am I not subtle at all?

398
00:30:08,910 --> 00:30:10,690
What happened last night?

399
00:30:11,690 --> 00:30:13,170
Spill everything.

400
00:30:13,240 --> 00:30:14,150
Spill everything.

401
00:30:20,950 --> 00:30:24,500
I and Yotha…

402
00:30:28,080 --> 00:30:29,164
we’re going to compete.

403
00:30:29,820 --> 00:30:30,402
Compete in what?

404
00:30:32,696 --> 00:30:33,779
I’m scared of the dark.

405
00:30:34,754 --> 00:30:35,896
Yotha is scared of love.

406
00:30:35,936 --> 00:30:39,601
Whoever overcomes their fear first wins.

407
00:30:42,954 --> 00:30:45,600
If you’re not shy, why are your ears red?

408
00:30:48,634 --> 00:30:50,000
There’s more to it than that, right?

409
00:30:53,810 --> 00:30:54,299
No.

410
00:30:59,696 --> 00:31:00,349
Well,

411
00:31:01,644 --> 00:31:02,804
Yotha said

412
00:31:04,782 --> 00:31:09,062
if he can overcome his fear…

413
00:31:09,989 --> 00:31:11,400
Well…

414
00:31:11,700 --> 00:31:12,358
What?

415
00:31:12,382 --> 00:31:12,875
Hmm?

416
00:31:14,250 --> 00:31:16,179
I must take responsibility for his feelings.

417
00:31:17,444 --> 00:31:17,967
What?

418
00:31:19,331 --> 00:31:20,634
Did Yotha really say that?

419
00:31:22,386 --> 00:31:23,398
After he said

420
00:31:23,785 --> 00:31:25,004
you must take responsibility for his feelings,

421
00:31:25,228 --> 00:31:27,539
what did you two do?

422
00:31:35,922 --> 00:31:36,837
Nothing.

423
00:31:37,022 --> 00:31:37,586
We each went to sleep.

424
00:31:41,150 --> 00:31:42,838
- Sadhu, if you’re lying, I hope you…
- Hey, Fai.

425
00:31:43,533 --> 00:31:44,051
Don’t!

426
00:31:44,422 --> 00:31:45,404
My family takes cursing seriously.

427
00:31:45,903 --> 00:31:47,303
My mom won’t even let me swear.

428
00:31:47,340 --> 00:31:48,395
It’s a serious and sensitive matter.

429
00:31:49,299 --> 00:31:50,354
I’ll let you get away with it this time.

430
00:31:53,875 --> 00:31:56,398
Did you give him your word

431
00:31:56,808 --> 00:31:59,263
that you’d take responsibility for his feelings?

432
00:32:00,970 --> 00:32:02,786
I don’t think so.

433
00:32:02,900 --> 00:32:03,767
It’s too late, right?

434
00:32:04,029 --> 00:32:04,497
Yeah.

435
00:32:05,870 --> 00:32:06,634
What do you mean ‘it’s too late’?

436
00:32:07,632 --> 00:32:09,798
You’ve really fallen for Yotha, haven’t you?

437
00:32:12,829 --> 00:32:13,604
Well,

438
00:32:15,663 --> 00:32:16,841
I’m…

439
00:32:17,456 --> 00:32:18,915
not…

440
00:32:19,044 --> 00:32:20,105
You’re not into him?

441
00:32:20,502 --> 00:32:21,653
I’m not sure.

442
00:32:23,853 --> 00:32:24,885
Oh, shit.

443
00:32:25,303 --> 00:32:26,020
Fai,

444
00:32:26,400 --> 00:32:27,401
please don’t tell Yotha.

445
00:32:27,420 --> 00:32:28,090
I beg you.

446
00:32:28,856 --> 00:32:29,420
Of course not.

447
00:32:30,137 --> 00:32:31,075
I won’t tell your secret.

448
00:32:32,007 --> 00:32:34,001
But when will you be sure?

449
00:32:38,214 --> 00:32:38,703
Listen.

450
00:32:39,315 --> 00:32:40,002
I have a shortcut.

451
00:32:42,040 --> 00:32:44,610
TEST YOUR FEELINGS FOR YOUR FRIEND QUIZ
ANSWER YES OR NO

452
00:32:45,848 --> 00:32:47,210
Will it work?

453
00:32:47,434 --> 00:32:48,402
If we don’t try, we’ll never know.

454
00:32:49,779 --> 00:32:51,054
What do you want to do, Gun?

455
00:32:51,413 --> 00:32:52,503
I’m not forcing you.

456
00:32:55,871 --> 00:32:56,601
Are you going to try it?

457
00:33:12,899 --> 00:33:13,494
Ugh.

458
00:33:13,816 --> 00:33:14,622
Damn it.

459
00:33:15,702 --> 00:33:16,740
Why did you touch my hand?

460
00:33:17,430 --> 00:33:18,857
- I’m in a bad mood.
- I’ll go wash my hands.

461
00:33:19,031 --> 00:33:19,668
Go.

462
00:33:21,431 --> 00:33:21,946
Arm.

463
00:33:25,008 --> 00:33:27,007
Can I still switch to another field?

464
00:33:28,500 --> 00:33:30,662
- It’s only the second year but I’m already dying here.
- 10.

465
00:33:30,800 --> 00:33:32,200
- You look dead.
- 9, 8.

466
00:33:32,564 --> 00:33:32,951
7.

467
00:33:33,020 --> 00:33:33,434
6.

468
00:33:33,450 --> 00:33:33,777
5.

469
00:33:33,798 --> 00:33:35,010
4, 3, 2, 1.

470
00:33:35,040 --> 00:33:35,958
Hi, Arc.

471
00:33:35,973 --> 00:33:36,497
I knew it.

472
00:33:36,979 --> 00:33:37,509
Hi.

473
00:33:37,619 --> 00:33:38,800
Where are you going after this?

474
00:33:39,194 --> 00:33:40,321
We’re not going anywhere.

475
00:33:40,634 --> 00:33:42,417
Just walking to the car is tiring enough.

476
00:33:42,691 --> 00:33:43,677
Then let’s split here.

477
00:33:45,357 --> 00:33:47,247
If you don’t get something in your lessons,

478
00:33:47,312 --> 00:33:48,094
you can always ask me.

479
00:33:48,318 --> 00:33:50,794
But now, let’s go grab something delicious to eat.

480
00:33:51,022 --> 00:33:51,496
Come on.

481
00:33:51,555 --> 00:33:51,995
Let’s go.

482
00:33:52,121 --> 00:33:53,202
I’ll help carry your bag.

483
00:33:53,250 --> 00:33:53,902
Thank you.

484
00:33:54,998 --> 00:33:56,002
I’m leaving now. Bye.

485
00:33:56,693 --> 00:33:57,786
What’s wrong with you?

486
00:33:58,848 --> 00:33:59,635
See you.

487
00:33:59,703 --> 00:34:00,475
See you.

488
00:34:00,783 --> 00:34:02,057
Oh, you’re bragging.

489
00:34:03,985 --> 00:34:05,405
I’m jealous of people in relationships.

490
00:34:06,801 --> 00:34:07,838
I want a partner!

491
00:34:08,608 --> 00:34:09,349
Your partner is here.

492
00:34:10,684 --> 00:34:11,437
I’m picking you up.

493
00:34:11,613 --> 00:34:12,222
Okay.

494
00:34:13,022 --> 00:34:14,285
I’m so tired.

495
00:34:14,530 --> 00:34:15,096
Can you take this?

496
00:34:15,111 --> 00:34:15,570
Sure.

497
00:34:16,865 --> 00:34:18,198
Po, I have to go.

498
00:34:19,632 --> 00:34:20,417
See you, Po.

499
00:34:21,577 --> 00:34:22,041
Let’s go.

500
00:34:25,200 --> 00:34:27,870
Is that a trick?

501
00:34:28,788 --> 00:34:29,825
Let me just try it.

502
00:34:32,345 --> 00:34:33,191
I’m so jealous!

503
00:34:33,740 --> 00:34:35,191
I want a partner!

504
00:34:42,285 --> 00:34:43,207
Let’s try again.

505
00:34:43,459 --> 00:34:44,419
I want a partner!

506
00:34:44,482 --> 00:34:45,545
I want a partner!

507
00:34:45,825 --> 00:34:47,131
I want a partner!

508
00:35:09,779 --> 00:35:10,586
I don’t think so.

509
00:35:10,847 --> 00:35:11,717
I probably got the trick wrong.

510
00:35:21,622 --> 00:35:22,179
You like him!

511
00:35:22,709 --> 00:35:23,814
Keep it down!

512
00:35:26,568 --> 00:35:27,056
Gun,

513
00:35:28,503 --> 00:35:29,717
do you really like Yotha?

514
00:35:30,322 --> 00:35:30,822
Keep it down!

515
00:35:30,896 --> 00:35:32,271
You like my brother, Gun?

516
00:35:32,297 --> 00:35:33,035
Keep it down!

517
00:35:33,056 --> 00:35:33,721
Are you crazy?

518
00:35:33,742 --> 00:35:34,188
Gun!

519
00:35:34,869 --> 00:35:35,368
Beagle.

520
00:35:38,457 --> 00:35:39,160
You like me?

521
00:36:10,671 --> 00:36:12,496
Yotha, listen to me.

522
00:36:13,088 --> 00:36:14,797
It’s not what you think.

523
00:36:15,165 --> 00:36:16,014
You’re getting it wrong

524
00:36:40,770 --> 00:36:41,702
Why did you stop?

525
00:36:44,270 --> 00:36:45,274
You like me, Beagle?

526
00:36:46,971 --> 00:36:47,797
Let go of me.

527
00:36:48,983 --> 00:36:49,471
Let go.

528
00:36:53,954 --> 00:36:55,379
It’s not what you think.

529
00:36:55,471 --> 00:36:56,564
I can explain.

530
00:36:56,580 --> 00:36:57,411
If it’s not what I think,

531
00:36:58,379 --> 00:36:59,699
does that mean you don’t like me?

532
00:37:02,150 --> 00:37:03,106
It’s not that, either.

533
00:37:03,454 --> 00:37:04,106
So it means you like me.

534
00:37:04,394 --> 00:37:06,345
Don’t pressure me now.

535
00:37:06,545 --> 00:37:07,413
I’m slow.

536
00:37:08,020 --> 00:37:09,402
Let me process it first.

537
00:37:14,610 --> 00:37:15,197
Well,

538
00:37:17,022 --> 00:37:21,237
Kong thinks we’re…

539
00:37:22,903 --> 00:37:23,463
Mm-hmm?

540
00:37:24,071 --> 00:37:25,300
In a situationship.

541
00:37:27,389 --> 00:37:28,604
But I already denied it.

542
00:37:31,460 --> 00:37:32,068
And then?

543
00:37:33,625 --> 00:37:37,251
And then he didn’t believe me.

544
00:37:37,850 --> 00:37:40,527
So he made me take this crazy quiz.

545
00:37:40,640 --> 00:37:41,705
I went along with it,

546
00:37:43,167 --> 00:37:44,798
and the result was

547
00:37:48,611 --> 00:37:49,711
I like you.

548
00:37:52,401 --> 00:37:54,902
But there are many different kinds
of "like" and "love."

549
00:37:55,545 --> 00:37:56,241
Right, Yotha?

550
00:37:56,560 --> 00:37:58,413
I might like you as a friend.

551
00:37:58,610 --> 00:37:59,400
What did the quiz say?

552
00:38:01,220 --> 00:38:02,515
Just ignore it.

553
00:38:02,792 --> 00:38:03,502
Question 1?

554
00:38:14,440 --> 00:38:16,397
IN CASE YOU WANT TO TAKE IT
WHEN YOU’RE MORE LEVEL-HEADED

555
00:38:16,397 --> 00:38:18,170
P.S. YOU CAN ASK YOTHA TO TAKE IT TOO.

556
00:38:22,977 --> 00:38:23,897
Do you really want to know?

557
00:38:24,125 --> 00:38:24,897
Do I look like I’m joking?

558
00:38:28,976 --> 00:38:30,897
Just answer yes or no.

559
00:38:32,665 --> 00:38:33,294
Question 1.

560
00:38:34,121 --> 00:38:35,558
You feel an instant connection.

561
00:38:40,065 --> 00:38:40,598
Yes.

562
00:38:45,311 --> 00:38:46,010
Question 2.

563
00:38:47,765 --> 00:38:49,951
You think of them all the time.

564
00:38:50,346 --> 00:38:50,899
No.

565
00:38:54,631 --> 00:38:55,402
Question 3.

566
00:38:56,720 --> 00:38:58,250
You steal a glance at them
every time you get a chance.

567
00:39:04,078 --> 00:39:04,625
Yes.

568
00:39:05,149 --> 00:39:05,638
Really?

569
00:39:08,041 --> 00:39:09,902
Why do you steal a glance?

570
00:39:12,828 --> 00:39:13,854
I like looking at that dog.

571
00:39:14,527 --> 00:39:15,327
It’s cute.

572
00:39:16,677 --> 00:39:17,268
You jerk.

573
00:39:18,379 --> 00:39:18,922
Question 4.

574
00:39:19,731 --> 00:39:21,579
You’re in a better mood than usual
when you’re near them.

575
00:39:23,367 --> 00:39:24,026
(Special, right?)

576
00:39:24,622 --> 00:39:25,471
I mean me.

577
00:39:26,257 --> 00:39:27,099
Am I special?

578
00:39:32,537 --> 00:39:33,117
Mm.

579
00:39:38,017 --> 00:39:38,614
Question 5.

580
00:39:39,583 --> 00:39:42,225
You want to get closer to them
and know about them.

581
00:39:42,674 --> 00:39:44,602
(This food allergy question, I understand.)

582
00:39:45,053 --> 00:39:46,770
But my favorite color and food?

583
00:39:47,284 --> 00:39:48,346
Why do they want to know?

584
00:39:48,727 --> 00:39:50,465
Who do I hand this to once I finish filling it out?

585
00:39:51,315 --> 00:39:51,922
Me.

586
00:39:54,588 --> 00:39:55,100
Yes.

587
00:40:00,056 --> 00:40:01,204
Question…

588
00:40:04,651 --> 00:40:05,207
Question 6.

589
00:40:06,757 --> 00:40:08,207
You want their attention.

590
00:40:10,463 --> 00:40:11,302
Sorry.

591
00:40:12,376 --> 00:40:13,318
I was in a rush this morning,

592
00:40:13,330 --> 00:40:14,231
so I forgot to get your tie ready for you.

593
00:40:20,794 --> 00:40:21,340
Yes.

594
00:40:24,648 --> 00:40:25,894
Question…

595
00:40:28,204 --> 00:40:28,930
What question is it now?

596
00:40:29,345 --> 00:40:29,939
Question 7.

597
00:40:32,213 --> 00:40:33,528
Ah, Question 7.

598
00:40:35,180 --> 00:40:36,902
You want to take care of them and make them...

599
00:40:38,915 --> 00:40:39,703
happy.

600
00:40:41,020 --> 00:40:41,545
Yes.

601
00:40:43,890 --> 00:40:44,668
Question 8.

602
00:40:45,826 --> 00:40:47,949
You don’t like it when
you see them with someone else.

603
00:40:50,408 --> 00:40:51,268
I think yes.

604
00:40:55,352 --> 00:40:56,257
Question 9.

605
00:40:56,813 --> 00:40:58,179
Your heart beats fast

606
00:40:58,728 --> 00:40:59,568
when you’re near them.

607
00:41:01,097 --> 00:41:01,600
No.

608
00:41:01,776 --> 00:41:02,570
If your heart doesn’t beat,

609
00:41:02,724 --> 00:41:03,903
you’ll die, Yotha.

610
00:41:11,965 --> 00:41:12,711
Last question.

611
00:41:14,543 --> 00:41:15,794
You want to change yourself

612
00:41:15,814 --> 00:41:17,540
and face your fear because of them.

613
00:41:20,432 --> 00:41:20,998
Skip.

614
00:41:21,837 --> 00:41:22,640
I’ll submit it then.

615
00:41:34,721 --> 00:41:37,462
You must’ve been thinking about someone else
while you were answering.

616
00:41:37,920 --> 00:41:39,294
Don’t pretend. I’m onto you.

617
00:41:40,202 --> 00:41:40,705
No.

618
00:41:44,288 --> 00:41:46,460
Oh, I bet you just gave random answers.

619
00:41:47,440 --> 00:41:51,200
Come on. I’m onto you.

620
00:41:57,050 --> 00:41:57,899
While I was answering,

621
00:41:59,438 --> 00:42:00,213
I was thinking about you.

622
00:42:04,168 --> 00:42:09,348
♪ It’s you, only you, who teaches me love ♪

623
00:42:09,518 --> 00:42:15,435
♪ It’s you, only you, who makes me see ♪

624
00:42:15,788 --> 00:42:17,868
♪ What true love is like  ♪

625
00:42:37,099 --> 00:42:38,103
Damn it, Kong.

626
00:42:39,293 --> 00:42:40,562
What the hell is this quiz?

627
00:42:41,434 --> 00:42:45,912
♪ No one else, just you ♪

628
00:42:57,268 --> 00:42:58,607
If you’re sleepy, go to bed.

629
00:42:59,143 --> 00:43:00,702
You’ve been working all day.

630
00:43:01,045 --> 00:43:01,810
You must be so tired.

631
00:43:03,069 --> 00:43:03,805
I’m tired

632
00:43:04,854 --> 00:43:05,922
but I want to be with you.

633
00:43:06,908 --> 00:43:07,592
I miss you.

634
00:43:10,268 --> 00:43:11,197
What do you mean you miss me?

635
00:43:11,601 --> 00:43:12,835
We’ve been together all day.

636
00:43:13,828 --> 00:43:14,902
I miss you all the time.

637
00:43:20,186 --> 00:43:21,564
Alright, up to you then.

638
00:43:22,248 --> 00:43:24,297
If you’re sleepy, you can take a nap here.

639
00:43:24,671 --> 00:43:26,321
Once I’m done studying, I’ll wake you up.

640
00:43:26,705 --> 00:43:27,865
Then we can go to sleep in the bedroom.

641
00:43:28,505 --> 00:43:29,226
Okay.

642
00:43:41,580 --> 00:43:43,998
Oh, you’re really sleeping.

643
00:43:52,788 --> 00:43:53,600
You startled me.

644
00:43:54,334 --> 00:43:55,040
Go to sleep.

645
00:43:55,783 --> 00:43:56,902
I can’t focus right now.

646
00:44:11,881 --> 00:44:12,395
Here you go.

647
00:44:18,383 --> 00:44:18,914
Hey.

648
00:44:20,280 --> 00:44:21,402
When did you arrive, Mom?

649
00:44:22,402 --> 00:44:23,066
Come and sit down.

650
00:44:23,078 --> 00:44:23,983
Get something to eat.

651
00:44:25,460 --> 00:44:25,970
Okay.

652
00:44:31,525 --> 00:44:32,903
Why did you sleep here last night?

653
00:44:33,226 --> 00:44:34,087
Did you talk to your mom beforehand?

654
00:44:35,093 --> 00:44:35,650
No.

655
00:44:36,223 --> 00:44:38,001
I missed my bed at home, so I came back.

656
00:44:40,819 --> 00:44:42,091
How’s the on-campus dorm?

657
00:44:42,537 --> 00:44:43,755
Can Yotha live there okay?

658
00:44:46,281 --> 00:44:46,976
Yes.

659
00:44:47,521 --> 00:44:49,500
The dorm was just renovated.

660
00:44:49,762 --> 00:44:51,066
Yotha can live there comfortably.

661
00:44:52,382 --> 00:44:54,268
Does Newton come home at all?

662
00:44:54,840 --> 00:44:57,171
About once every two months.

663
00:45:00,936 --> 00:45:02,899
Let me know when you’re visiting again

664
00:45:03,577 --> 00:45:05,622
so I can tell Yotha and Newton to come too.

665
00:45:07,952 --> 00:45:08,622
Drink some milk.

666
00:45:15,570 --> 00:45:16,105
Here.

667
00:45:19,275 --> 00:45:20,379
Faifa is allergic to cow’s milk.

668
00:45:26,586 --> 00:45:27,262
It’s okay.

669
00:45:28,020 --> 00:45:29,697
You must’ve confused me with Yotha.

670
00:45:30,914 --> 00:45:32,017
You have many kids.

671
00:45:33,080 --> 00:45:33,902
It’s impossible to remember everything.

672
00:45:34,454 --> 00:45:35,010
Right?

673
00:45:56,430 --> 00:45:58,900
Hey, are you guys doing anything this evening?

674
00:45:59,586 --> 00:46:00,240
How about dinner?

675
00:46:00,510 --> 00:46:01,314
Sure. I’m free.

676
00:46:01,642 --> 00:46:02,201
Me too.

677
00:46:02,653 --> 00:46:03,700
I’m meeting up with my group
for some bonding time.

678
00:46:03,995 --> 00:46:04,605
I can’t join you guys.

679
00:46:05,210 --> 00:46:06,447
Bonding with who?

680
00:46:07,466 --> 00:46:08,297
Your peer mentors

681
00:46:09,001 --> 00:46:09,834
or your love?

682
00:46:11,205 --> 00:46:12,822
Love? You wish!

683
00:46:15,557 --> 00:46:16,311
Hey.

684
00:46:16,600 --> 00:46:18,453
Is there anything you haven’t told us?

685
00:46:18,992 --> 00:46:20,425
Give us updates now.

686
00:46:20,617 --> 00:46:21,254
Don’t worry.

687
00:46:21,558 --> 00:46:22,514
I’ll update you guys.

688
00:46:22,749 --> 00:46:23,398
Just wait till he’s gone.

689
00:46:24,998 --> 00:46:26,503
You might as well tell them while I’m here.

690
00:46:26,629 --> 00:46:27,198
Can I?

691
00:46:27,383 --> 00:46:28,380
Stop trying to be cute.

692
00:46:28,908 --> 00:46:30,376
Come on, shedding chihuahua.

693
00:46:33,340 --> 00:46:35,108
- He looks like a chihuahua.
- A shedding chihuahua.

694
00:46:38,480 --> 00:46:41,290
BANG ON POCHANA

695
00:46:41,694 --> 00:46:43,040
This place is as crowded as ever.

696
00:46:43,171 --> 00:46:43,642
Yeah.

697
00:46:45,262 --> 00:46:46,777
I missed our early days of flirting.

698
00:46:48,231 --> 00:46:49,035
Oh, hey, Yotha.

699
00:46:49,995 --> 00:46:51,402
Pun and Jet can’t make it anymore.

700
00:46:51,583 --> 00:46:52,317
Something came up again.

701
00:46:52,331 --> 00:46:53,422
I don’t know if it’s an excuse or not.

702
00:46:53,438 --> 00:46:53,925
Mm.

703
00:46:55,330 --> 00:46:56,109
Did you drive here?

704
00:46:56,269 --> 00:46:57,001
No, I didn’t.

705
00:46:57,918 --> 00:46:59,900
Then you can go all out tonight.

706
00:47:02,380 --> 00:47:03,506
Everyone can go all out,

707
00:47:04,004 --> 00:47:04,647
except you.

708
00:47:04,937 --> 00:47:07,263
Come on, Arc.

709
00:47:07,280 --> 00:47:08,623
Not again.

710
00:47:08,740 --> 00:47:10,586
Can’t you make an exception tonight?

711
00:47:10,720 --> 00:47:11,137
No.

712
00:47:11,194 --> 00:47:11,890
Please.

713
00:47:14,431 --> 00:47:16,197
Yotha, can you talk to him for me?

714
00:47:31,302 --> 00:47:32,309
What took you so long?

715
00:47:33,685 --> 00:47:34,373
Sorry.

716
00:47:34,837 --> 00:47:36,349
The motorbike taxi rider got me lost.

717
00:47:36,438 --> 00:47:37,177
Hey.

718
00:47:37,460 --> 00:47:38,397
Good call.

719
00:47:38,890 --> 00:47:39,957
You didn’t bring your motorbike.

720
00:47:40,056 --> 00:47:41,214
Of course not.

721
00:47:41,700 --> 00:47:43,754
Then I’ll take you down tonight.

722
00:47:44,453 --> 00:47:45,506
Bring it.

723
00:47:45,825 --> 00:47:47,760
But I'm a very lightweight drinker.

724
00:47:48,337 --> 00:47:49,934
Just so you know.

725
00:47:50,767 --> 00:47:51,269
Come on.

726
00:47:53,131 --> 00:47:54,225
Let’s go.

727
00:47:55,866 --> 00:47:57,053
I never got to get drunk.

728
00:47:57,752 --> 00:47:58,234
Hey.

729
00:47:59,391 --> 00:48:00,494
Oh, hey, Gun!

730
00:48:03,580 --> 00:48:04,077
Have a seat.

731
00:48:04,105 --> 00:48:04,608
Hi.

732
00:48:04,934 --> 00:48:05,934
Have a seat. Come on.

733
00:48:07,943 --> 00:48:08,558
Why are you confused?

734
00:48:09,177 --> 00:48:10,422
It’s just the two of us in our group.

735
00:48:10,830 --> 00:48:12,505
If we don’t join the others, it’ll be too lonely.

736
00:48:13,574 --> 00:48:14,004
Go.

737
00:48:14,232 --> 00:48:14,924
Sit down.

738
00:48:14,951 --> 00:48:15,656
Sit down.

739
00:48:18,910 --> 00:48:19,648
- Hi.
- Hi.

740
00:48:19,751 --> 00:48:20,623
- Hi.
- Hi.

741
00:48:27,330 --> 00:48:28,251
Why didn't you tell me you were coming here?

742
00:48:29,506 --> 00:48:30,469
Because you didn’t ask.

743
00:48:32,764 --> 00:48:33,540
Alright.

744
00:48:34,284 --> 00:48:35,925
Before we get drunk and lose ourselves tonight,

745
00:48:36,460 --> 00:48:37,838
I have a gift for you, Yotha.

746
00:48:39,557 --> 00:48:40,068
Open it.

747
00:48:43,808 --> 00:48:45,924
You guys will start wearing the jacket sooner

748
00:48:46,386 --> 00:48:47,801
and you didn’t have the pinning ceremony,

749
00:48:48,080 --> 00:48:50,217
so I prepared this for you as a keepsake.

750
00:48:51,011 --> 00:48:53,702
I’ve already added your name,
major, and cohort to it.

751
00:48:54,379 --> 00:48:57,000
Official Welcome to Engineering, Yotha.

752
00:48:58,048 --> 00:48:58,656
Thank you.

753
00:49:05,108 --> 00:49:05,853
Come on.

754
00:49:06,192 --> 00:49:08,155
Don’t give me those insulting eyes.

755
00:49:10,063 --> 00:49:11,752
I have it for you too.

756
00:49:11,767 --> 00:49:13,213
Thank you.

757
00:49:13,590 --> 00:49:15,370
But you have to buy a pin yourself
from the Student Association.

758
00:49:15,748 --> 00:49:16,983
When I went there today, it was sold out.

759
00:49:17,020 --> 00:49:18,783
You know my size.

760
00:49:19,385 --> 00:49:20,837
Now that we all have our glasses,

761
00:49:20,985 --> 00:49:21,598
cheers.

762
00:49:22,411 --> 00:49:23,365
Cheers, guys.

763
00:49:23,663 --> 00:49:25,365
Cheers!

764
00:49:33,151 --> 00:49:35,577
How about another cheers?

765
00:49:47,740 --> 00:49:48,718
What’s that?

766
00:49:50,604 --> 00:49:51,035
Hmm?

767
00:49:51,050 --> 00:49:51,663
That.

768
00:49:52,634 --> 00:49:53,299
Oh.

769
00:49:54,216 --> 00:49:57,315
It’s the Perfect 10 Liners bracelet, Gun.

770
00:49:57,577 --> 00:49:59,131
How come you don’t know what it is?

771
00:49:59,217 --> 00:50:00,148
It’s so cool.

772
00:50:02,226 --> 00:50:03,441
What about our group?

773
00:50:03,854 --> 00:50:04,600
We don’t have any.

774
00:50:04,914 --> 00:50:06,903
It’s an important tradition
of the Perfect 10 Liners.

775
00:50:07,382 --> 00:50:08,714
Bummer.

776
00:50:09,025 --> 00:50:10,314
It’s beautiful.

777
00:50:10,709 --> 00:50:11,616
I want to wear one too.

778
00:50:11,625 --> 00:50:12,580
Where can I buy it?

779
00:50:13,331 --> 00:50:14,242
It’s not for sale.

780
00:50:16,570 --> 00:50:18,032
Is it that rare, Arc?

781
00:50:18,045 --> 00:50:18,588
Hey!

782
00:50:20,950 --> 00:50:21,500
What’s wrong?

783
00:50:22,390 --> 00:50:25,948
I forgot to take Yotha to get his bracelets.

784
00:50:27,382 --> 00:50:28,601
Do I need them?

785
00:50:28,731 --> 00:50:30,302
It’s important.

786
00:50:30,613 --> 00:50:34,180
I’ll take you when Tawan is free.

787
00:50:34,210 --> 00:50:36,048
Sorry. I forgot.

788
00:50:36,300 --> 00:50:37,930
These are our matching bracelets.

789
00:50:38,579 --> 00:50:40,139
We wear one ourselves,

790
00:50:40,630 --> 00:50:41,920
and our special someone wears the other.

791
00:50:44,214 --> 00:50:45,371
How sweet.

792
00:50:45,447 --> 00:50:48,235
Actually, you might be able to get one, Gun,

793
00:50:48,957 --> 00:50:50,939
if you’re dating someone in our group.

794
00:50:52,010 --> 00:50:53,768
Oh.

795
00:50:53,838 --> 00:50:57,608
But all the Perfect 10 Liners members are taken.

796
00:50:58,005 --> 00:50:59,198
Wait, there’s Yotha left.

797
00:50:59,275 --> 00:51:00,300
Are you single, Yotha?

798
00:51:00,460 --> 00:51:02,842
You can share one with Gun.

799
00:51:02,962 --> 00:51:04,545
You can share one with Gun.

800
00:51:05,031 --> 00:51:06,524
Share one with him.

801
00:51:06,557 --> 00:51:07,884
Share one with Gun.

802
00:51:07,933 --> 00:51:09,149
Arm, you’re drunk.

803
00:51:09,257 --> 00:51:10,437
I’m not drunk, Arc.

804
00:51:10,465 --> 00:51:12,121
Yotha, let Gun wear it.

805
00:51:12,130 --> 00:51:13,280
Please. I want to wear it.

806
00:51:14,075 --> 00:51:15,280
Share it.

807
00:51:15,561 --> 00:51:17,280
I want to wear it too.

808
00:51:17,848 --> 00:51:18,884
Please.

809
00:51:19,437 --> 00:51:21,189
So we can all have one.

810
00:51:21,210 --> 00:51:22,265
I want to wear it.

811
00:51:22,280 --> 00:51:25,176
- Please.
- Share one with him.

812
00:51:27,420 --> 00:51:27,964
Mm.

813
00:51:28,168 --> 00:51:30,340
Yay!

814
00:51:30,813 --> 00:51:32,450
I’ll get to wear the bracelet!

815
00:51:32,490 --> 00:51:33,411
Cheers!

816
00:51:34,420 --> 00:51:35,844
We’re not drinking to get drunk.

817
00:51:36,149 --> 00:51:36,952
You’re wasted.

818
00:51:48,114 --> 00:51:49,841
You look like a mess.

819
00:51:49,866 --> 00:51:50,696
What’s wrong with you?

820
00:51:50,727 --> 00:51:51,805
I’m walking straight!

821
00:51:54,245 --> 00:51:57,278
Sam is such a loser.

822
00:51:57,322 --> 00:51:58,780
He doesn’t even take care of his own mentee.

823
00:51:58,854 --> 00:52:00,152
Agreed.

824
00:52:00,760 --> 00:52:02,496
Yotha is taking care of Gun.

825
00:52:05,911 --> 00:52:08,400
It’s a relief that you’re here, Yotha.

826
00:52:09,595 --> 00:52:10,297
Good.

827
00:52:11,922 --> 00:52:13,198
Hey, Yotha.

828
00:52:13,257 --> 00:52:13,703
Yes?

829
00:52:13,794 --> 00:52:14,940
I’ll give you a ride to the on-campus dorm.

830
00:52:16,008 --> 00:52:16,512
Okay.

831
00:52:17,441 --> 00:52:18,434
No!

832
00:52:18,459 --> 00:52:19,185
No?

833
00:52:19,379 --> 00:52:20,072
He’s stubborn.

834
00:52:20,214 --> 00:52:22,070
I want to eat fried chicken.

835
00:52:22,223 --> 00:52:23,900
There’s a place up ahead.

836
00:52:25,151 --> 00:52:26,922
Take me there.

837
00:52:27,934 --> 00:52:29,416
You guys can go ahead without us.

838
00:52:29,908 --> 00:52:31,177
I’ll just get a ride later.

839
00:52:31,949 --> 00:52:32,546
It’s okay.

840
00:52:32,595 --> 00:52:33,514
It won’t take long. I can wait.

841
00:52:34,805 --> 00:52:36,580
Look at Arm.

842
00:52:36,629 --> 00:52:38,580
Hey, Yotha!

843
00:52:39,047 --> 00:52:40,580
I said I’m not drunk.

844
00:52:40,884 --> 00:52:42,106
My bro is not drunk.

845
00:52:42,149 --> 00:52:42,865
Exactly.

846
00:52:43,364 --> 00:52:44,927
- I’m fine.
- Let’s see if you can stand on your own.

847
00:52:53,287 --> 00:52:53,805
Okay.

848
00:52:54,234 --> 00:52:55,001
You can’t even stand up.

849
00:52:55,151 --> 00:52:56,094
I’m seeing stars.

850
00:52:56,339 --> 00:52:58,094
We’re leaving then.

851
00:52:58,582 --> 00:53:00,462
Can you bring the bag in your car?

852
00:53:00,481 --> 00:53:01,453
Sure.

853
00:53:01,694 --> 00:53:03,165
I’ll give it to security.

854
00:53:03,183 --> 00:53:03,668
Okay.

855
00:53:04,117 --> 00:53:04,605
Alright.

856
00:53:04,623 --> 00:53:06,035
Arm!

857
00:53:06,189 --> 00:53:07,902
- See you soon!
- Bye-bye.

858
00:53:07,934 --> 00:53:09,148
See you soon.

859
00:53:10,680 --> 00:53:11,835
Don’t get drunk like this again.

860
00:53:12,034 --> 00:53:13,197
- Take care of yourself.
- You’re the drunk one.

861
00:53:25,841 --> 00:53:27,168
Why won’t you eat in the room?

862
00:53:27,589 --> 00:53:28,668
We’re almost there.

863
00:53:30,641 --> 00:53:31,506
I’m hungry now,

864
00:53:32,222 --> 00:53:33,202
so I’m eating now.

865
00:53:34,466 --> 00:53:35,017
Do you want a bite?

866
00:53:36,511 --> 00:53:37,293
Come on.

867
00:53:37,478 --> 00:53:38,102
Just one bite.

868
00:53:39,346 --> 00:53:40,059
No.

869
00:53:43,795 --> 00:53:45,702
Do you always lose control when you’re drunk?

870
00:53:47,060 --> 00:53:48,497
Normally, I don’t remember.

871
00:53:54,557 --> 00:53:57,622
Normally, I can only
remember up until my fourth glass.

872
00:53:58,949 --> 00:54:00,801
Then before I know it, I want to eat fried chicken.

873
00:54:01,890 --> 00:54:03,881
I forget what happens in between.

874
00:54:05,632 --> 00:54:08,694
So you don’t remember
what you say when you’re drunk?

875
00:54:09,453 --> 00:54:11,072
A hundred percent no.

876
00:54:14,211 --> 00:54:16,922
But if I did something embarrassing,

877
00:54:17,814 --> 00:54:19,001
don’t tease me about it.

878
00:54:19,838 --> 00:54:20,669
I beg you.

879
00:54:21,881 --> 00:54:22,577
Not really.

880
00:54:26,576 --> 00:54:27,607
Now that you mention it,

881
00:54:28,497 --> 00:54:29,641
I want to know.

882
00:54:30,669 --> 00:54:31,204
Just a little bit.

883
00:54:34,490 --> 00:54:35,395
You said

884
00:54:35,780 --> 00:54:38,620
you wanted my Perfect 10 Liners bracelet.

885
00:54:40,694 --> 00:54:42,200
Perfect 10 Liners bracelet?

886
00:54:47,933 --> 00:54:49,823
(These are our matching bracelets.)

887
00:54:50,994 --> 00:54:52,260
It’s the Perfect 10 Liners bracelet.

888
00:54:53,080 --> 00:54:54,739
We wear one ourselves,

889
00:54:55,102 --> 00:54:57,502
and our special someone wears the other.

890
00:54:57,730 --> 00:54:59,502
Oh.

891
00:55:00,503 --> 00:55:01,354
There’s Yotha left.

892
00:55:01,715 --> 00:55:02,712
Are you single, Yotha?

893
00:55:03,062 --> 00:55:04,712
Share one with Gun.

894
00:55:06,075 --> 00:55:08,388
Share one with him.

895
00:55:10,551 --> 00:55:12,475
So we can all have one.

896
00:55:12,650 --> 00:55:13,640
Please.

897
00:55:13,663 --> 00:55:14,974
Share one with me.

898
00:55:14,990 --> 00:55:15,921
I want to wear it too.

899
00:55:37,665 --> 00:55:40,482
Don’t mind the drunk, Yotha.

900
00:55:42,197 --> 00:55:43,251
You’re blushing.

901
00:55:43,954 --> 00:55:45,130
This means you remember now, right?

902
00:55:45,884 --> 00:55:47,497
I remember it vaguely.

903
00:55:49,277 --> 00:55:50,274
Just vaguely?

904
00:55:55,099 --> 00:55:56,733
Just vaguely, huh?

905
00:56:05,945 --> 00:56:07,111
I’m full now.

906
00:56:08,709 --> 00:56:09,577
Let’s head back to the dorm.

907
00:56:10,666 --> 00:56:11,899
Let’s go. Come on.

908
00:56:12,007 --> 00:56:12,640
Get up.

909
00:56:12,659 --> 00:56:13,226
Come on, get up.

00:56:19,383 --> 00:56:21,681

As soon as I get my bracelets,

916
00:56:37,191 --> 00:56:38,198
I’ll give you one, Beagle.

917
00:56:40,158 --> 00:56:41,530
Don’t whine, okay?

918
00:56:46,364 --> 00:56:47,165
Got it?

919
00:56:47,840 --> 00:56:48,585
Got it.

920
00:56:48,850 --> 00:56:49,337
Hmm?

921
00:56:50,115 --> 00:56:51,579
Come on. Let’s go back to our room.

922
00:56:53,429 --> 00:56:54,508
Let’s go back to our room.

923
00:56:56,302 --> 00:56:57,096

Tie my tie for me.

927
00:57:09,247 --> 00:57:10,688
You don’t brush your teeth first these days.

928
00:57:10,982 --> 00:57:11,952
Because we’re close now.

929
00:57:16,011 --> 00:57:17,509
This is the first time I’ve seen you laugh.

930
00:57:18,201 --> 00:57:19,278
You two

931
00:57:19,626 --> 00:57:20,734
are just like me and my partner.

932
00:57:21,128 --> 00:57:22,231
If there’s anything, you have to tell me.

933
00:57:22,580 --> 00:57:24,820
Don’t think I won’t have time
for you while I’m interning.

934
00:57:25,308 --> 00:57:26,362
I’ll always have time for you.

935
00:57:26,620 --> 00:57:27,810
Are you going to New’s bar again?

936
00:57:27,995 --> 00:57:29,272
Can I ask you not to?

937
00:57:29,524 --> 00:57:31,139
I don’t want you to do anything bad again.

938
00:57:32,149 --> 00:57:33,499
I won’t let you go anywhere.
