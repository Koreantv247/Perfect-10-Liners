The next one
is from Computer Engineering.

5
00:00:31,721 --> 00:00:33,012
Let's give him a big hand.

6
00:00:34,616 --> 00:00:36,607
Please introduce yourself.

7
00:00:39,035 --> 00:00:41,422
Hi. My name is Witsawa.

8
00:00:41,743 --> 00:00:42,834
I used to go by Warat.

9
00:00:43,911 --> 00:00:45,419
You can call me Wine.

10
00:00:45,946 --> 00:00:47,501
(My university life)

11
00:00:48,000 --> 00:00:49,557
(starts off kind of confusing.)

12
00:00:50,313 --> 00:00:51,860
Wine, your student code is

13
00:00:52,181 --> 00:00:56,284
0682.

14
00:00:56,548 --> 00:00:57,473
Hey, Pun!

15
00:00:57,473 --> 00:01:00,163
WINE

16
00:01:17,254 --> 00:01:19,019
I didn't bring any gifts.

17
00:01:19,706 --> 00:01:22,155
Let me treat you to a meal instead.

18
00:01:23,163 --> 00:01:24,927
See you, Witsarut.

19
00:01:24,927 --> 00:01:26,049
I'm Witsawa.

20
00:01:26,438 --> 00:01:28,714
(I get myself a weird peer mentor.)

21
00:01:28,714 --> 00:01:30,593
BANG ON POCHANA

22
00:01:31,902 --> 00:01:32,518
BANG ON POCHANA

23
00:01:32,518 --> 00:01:33,028
Wine!

24
00:01:33,601 --> 00:01:34,291
Come here.

25
00:01:34,497 --> 00:01:35,228
Hey.

26
00:01:35,640 --> 00:01:37,718
(No, a group of them.)

27
00:01:42,000 --> 00:01:42,963
Hi.

28
00:01:42,963 --> 00:01:43,677
Sit here, Wine.

29
00:01:43,677 --> 00:01:45,045
(People call them…)

30
00:01:45,526 --> 00:01:47,946
Welcome to Perfect 10 Liners.

31
00:01:50,512 --> 00:01:51,333
Hi, Wine.

32
00:01:51,791 --> 00:01:52,508
I'm Arm.

33
00:01:52,829 --> 00:01:54,134
I'm Yotha's peer mentor

34
00:01:54,720 --> 00:01:55,962
and Pun's peer mentee.

35
00:01:55,962 --> 00:01:56,923
This is Pun.

36
00:01:57,381 --> 00:01:58,369
She's Arc's peer mentee.

37
00:01:58,484 --> 00:01:59,999
Arc is Jet's peer mentee.

38
00:02:00,434 --> 00:02:02,723
Pun and Jet are a couple.

39
00:02:03,479 --> 00:02:05,978
Arc and I are…

40
00:02:06,080 --> 00:02:06,835
I'm Arc.

41
00:02:07,728 --> 00:02:08,467
I'm Arm's boyfriend.

42
00:02:09,487 --> 00:02:10,346
Of course.

43
00:02:11,217 --> 00:02:13,963
Arm, you explained it too quickly.

44
00:02:13,963 --> 00:02:15,994
You didn't give him time to process it.

45
00:02:16,887 --> 00:02:18,181
Look, Wine.

46
00:02:18,891 --> 00:02:20,257
All of us here

47
00:02:20,807 --> 00:02:21,960
are in Perfect 10 Liners.

48
00:02:21,960 --> 00:02:22,608
Yeah.

49
00:02:22,791 --> 00:02:25,349
Yeepun and I are together.

50
00:02:25,349 --> 00:02:27,303
Arc and Arm

51
00:02:27,303 --> 00:02:28,091
are also together.

52
00:02:28,091 --> 00:02:28,591
Yeah.

53
00:02:29,347 --> 00:02:31,340
As for Yotha,

54
00:02:48,000 --> 00:02:48,684
Hey.

55
00:02:48,913 --> 00:02:49,724
Stop what you're thinking.

56
00:02:50,223 --> 00:02:51,162
I'm already with someone.

57
00:02:55,836 --> 00:02:56,900
What did I miss?

58
00:02:58,641 --> 00:03:00,283
And who's this?

59
00:03:00,283 --> 00:03:01,362
It's Wine.

60
00:03:01,362 --> 00:03:02,220
He's my peer mentee.

61
00:03:04,373 --> 00:03:05,014
Oh.

62
00:03:05,183 --> 00:03:07,105
The Perfect 10 Liners is really something.

63
00:03:07,357 --> 00:03:09,398
I'm Gun. Nice to meet you.

64
00:03:09,673 --> 00:03:10,350
You too.

65
00:03:10,487 --> 00:03:12,303
As a new joiner,

66
00:03:12,785 --> 00:03:14,714
you get a chance to ask us

67
00:03:14,714 --> 00:03:15,910
one question.

68
00:03:17,160 --> 00:03:19,066
Whatever you ask will stay on this table.

69
00:03:20,349 --> 00:03:22,760
Why don't you ask them if I'm cute?

70
00:03:23,160 --> 00:03:25,463
I'll answer that I'm so cute.

71
00:03:26,952 --> 00:03:28,429
Come on.

72
00:03:29,185 --> 00:03:30,164
Hi, everyone.

73
00:03:30,164 --> 00:03:31,131
Hi.

74
00:03:31,452 --> 00:03:34,470
Fai, I told you
to stay away from my peer mentee.

75
00:03:34,470 --> 00:03:36,661
What? We're brothers.

76
00:03:36,661 --> 00:03:38,041
Your peer mentee is like my own.

77
00:03:38,041 --> 00:03:39,823
You said your friends
were at the bar next door.

78
00:03:39,823 --> 00:03:43,477
Yes, but my heart led me here.

79
00:03:43,752 --> 00:03:44,478
Fai!

80
00:03:44,730 --> 00:03:45,354
What?

81
00:03:45,628 --> 00:03:46,217
I'm going to splash this on you.

82
00:03:46,217 --> 00:03:47,189
Go ahead.

83
00:03:48,976 --> 00:03:50,162
Alright, I won't tease you anymore.

84
00:03:50,162 --> 00:03:51,551
Just ask them what you want to know.

85
00:04:03,648 --> 00:04:06,773
Arc and Arm,
how did you two get together?

86
00:04:14,480 --> 00:04:18,765
This stays between us, okay?

87
00:04:19,956 --> 00:04:20,726
But first,

88
00:04:21,240 --> 00:04:24,142
cheers!

89
00:04:24,669 --> 00:04:26,406
Cheers!

90
00:06:02,897 --> 00:06:04,061
WITSAWAKAM PRASART

91
00:06:04,061 --> 00:06:06,166
Why did you choose to study Engineering?

92
00:06:06,716 --> 00:06:09,425
I want to gain experience in what I love.

93
00:06:09,700 --> 00:06:12,116
I want to achieve my childhood dream
because that's the whole meaning of life.

94
00:06:12,280 --> 00:06:13,747
Is that the script you memorized?

95
00:06:16,840 --> 00:06:18,911
Try solving this question.

96
00:06:19,676 --> 00:06:20,301
Okay.

97
00:06:33,016 --> 00:06:34,836
Can I do this at home?

98
00:06:35,248 --> 00:06:36,008
There's no need.

99
00:06:36,160 --> 00:06:38,730
That's a question for a post-grad student.

100
00:06:38,730 --> 00:06:42,099
I just want you to have a look,
in case you might be able to solve it.

101
00:06:42,099 --> 00:06:43,220
Oh.

102
00:06:44,251 --> 00:06:46,029
I see your determination.

103
00:06:46,304 --> 00:06:48,846
Now, pitch yourself to us.

104
00:06:49,144 --> 00:06:51,112
Why should we accept you into this faculty?

105
00:06:53,242 --> 00:06:53,927
Alright.

106
00:06:55,027 --> 00:06:58,700
At school, I did so many
extracurricular activities.

107
00:06:58,700 --> 00:07:00,948
I even ran for school president.

108
00:07:01,200 --> 00:07:02,800
SCHOOL PRESIDENT ELECTION
Number 2.

109
00:07:03,991 --> 00:07:05,121
Come on now!

110
00:07:05,121 --> 00:07:06,412
Number 2.

111
00:07:07,145 --> 00:07:07,645
Number 1!

112
00:07:07,645 --> 00:07:09,316
You were the school president?

113
00:07:10,897 --> 00:07:11,770
Number 2.

114
00:07:11,770 --> 00:07:13,108
Is there a mistake?

115
00:07:13,108 --> 00:07:13,884
Number 2.

116
00:07:14,182 --> 00:07:14,898
Number 2.

117
00:07:15,219 --> 00:07:16,455
Number 2, again.

118
00:07:22,160 --> 00:07:23,362
I was a candidate,

119
00:07:23,522 --> 00:07:24,443
but I lost the election.

120
00:07:26,253 --> 00:07:31,248
Oh, and I led the Buddhist chanting
at the assembly.

121
00:07:31,477 --> 00:07:37,103
Araham Samma
Sambuddho Bhagava.

122
00:07:37,447 --> 00:07:40,831
I also showed the 7th graders
around the school garden.

123
00:07:41,220 --> 00:07:42,281
Let me show you how to loosen the soil.

124
00:07:42,281 --> 00:07:43,770
Teach us how it's done.

125
00:07:43,770 --> 00:07:44,464
Here.

126
00:07:45,747 --> 00:07:46,778
You do this.

127
00:07:48,153 --> 00:07:49,292
Oh, shit!

128
00:07:52,751 --> 00:07:53,527
Po!

129
00:07:53,802 --> 00:07:54,767
Watch out, Sand!

130
00:08:01,387 --> 00:08:03,350
There's nothing related to Engineering.

131
00:08:04,450 --> 00:08:05,369
Well…

132
00:08:06,606 --> 00:08:07,291
Oh!

133
00:08:07,291 --> 00:08:09,054
I love changing light bulbs.

134
00:08:09,054 --> 00:08:10,392
If I get into this faculty,

135
00:08:10,392 --> 00:08:11,726
I'll get better at it

136
00:08:11,726 --> 00:08:14,067
and be able to help other houses with it.

137
00:08:16,633 --> 00:08:18,397
What does your name Anon mean?

138
00:08:21,879 --> 00:08:26,201
Anon means, uh,

139
00:08:26,842 --> 00:08:27,990
a person who has no debt.

140
00:08:37,543 --> 00:08:39,515
Do you think he can make it?

141
00:08:39,515 --> 00:08:40,462
I'm worried about him, too.

142
00:08:40,462 --> 00:08:41,351
He's usually confused.

143
00:08:41,351 --> 00:08:42,256
I know, right?

144
00:08:42,256 --> 00:08:43,349
Gosh!

145
00:08:44,609 --> 00:08:45,509
Sand. Po.

146
00:08:48,143 --> 00:08:49,540
What did they ask you?

147
00:08:49,540 --> 00:08:50,735
How was it?

148
00:08:50,735 --> 00:08:51,704
Well…

149
00:08:51,704 --> 00:08:52,285
What?

150
00:08:52,285 --> 00:08:53,020
Just say it.

151
00:08:53,020 --> 00:08:53,667
Excuse me.

152
00:08:56,599 --> 00:08:57,991
What's your name?

153
00:08:58,907 --> 00:09:00,367
Oh, my name is…

154
00:09:00,367 --> 00:09:01,453
This is my friend, Arm.

155
00:09:04,637 --> 00:09:06,062
Arm, I see.

156
00:09:06,566 --> 00:09:07,066
Yes.

157
00:09:07,200 --> 00:09:08,805
What faculty are you in, Arm?

158
00:09:09,263 --> 00:09:09,879
Oh.

159
00:09:10,635 --> 00:09:14,799
If he passed the interview,
it'd be Electrical Engineering.

160
00:09:15,840 --> 00:09:17,825
Did you pass the interview?

161
00:09:18,306 --> 00:09:20,805
Why don't you guys ask me that
on my graduation day?

162
00:09:21,928 --> 00:09:22,775
Did you hear what I did?

163
00:09:24,585 --> 00:09:26,756
I passed, guys!

164
00:09:32,483 --> 00:09:35,615
So you're in Electrical Engineering, right?

165
00:09:36,692 --> 00:09:39,000
Well, yes.

166
00:09:39,344 --> 00:09:42,382
Can I take a photo of you
and post it on the Engineer Cute Boy page?

167
00:09:43,527 --> 00:09:44,688
To make people swoon a bit.

168
00:09:44,894 --> 00:09:47,561
Oh, well,

169
00:09:48,000 --> 00:09:50,228
are you sure that's a good idea?

170
00:09:51,465 --> 00:09:52,638
Of course.

171
00:09:52,638 --> 00:09:54,660
You look so cute.

172
00:09:54,912 --> 00:09:56,381
You'll definitely get a lot of likes.

173
00:09:59,359 --> 00:10:01,381
Oh, okay then.

174
00:10:04,199 --> 00:10:05,495
Your shirt is not wrinkled.

175
00:10:05,495 --> 00:10:06,893
It's perfectly neat.

176
00:10:06,893 --> 00:10:08,367
What about my hair?

177
00:10:08,756 --> 00:10:09,698
Your hair is perfect.

178
00:10:09,996 --> 00:10:10,591
Ready?

179
00:10:10,591 --> 00:10:13,385
Hold this for me.

180
00:10:13,522 --> 00:10:14,375
I'm ready.

181
00:10:14,925 --> 00:10:16,553
Can I take a photo of Arm alone?

182
00:10:16,553 --> 00:10:17,355
Oh.

183
00:10:19,028 --> 00:10:19,849
Am I not handsome?

184
00:10:19,849 --> 00:10:21,021
You're the most handsome, dude.

185
00:10:21,021 --> 00:10:22,022
You're the most handsome.

186
00:10:22,274 --> 00:10:23,181
Ready?

187
00:10:23,181 --> 00:10:25,382
One, two, three.

188
00:10:26,963 --> 00:10:27,879
ADORABLE ARM FROM ELECTRICAL ENGINEERING
/ ADMIN P.

189
00:10:27,879 --> 00:10:28,841
SO CUTE! THIS IS THE ONE!

190
00:10:28,841 --> 00:10:29,727
IS THERE ANYONE CUTER THAN HIM?

191
00:10:29,727 --> 00:10:31,129
I APPLY TO BE HIS MOMMY!

192
00:10:33,680 --> 00:10:34,476
Hey!

193
00:10:34,476 --> 00:10:35,858
Wow!

194
00:10:35,858 --> 00:10:37,420
This is freedom, guys!

195
00:10:37,420 --> 00:10:39,212
This is the first day I feel like a grown-up.

196
00:10:39,212 --> 00:10:40,559
You guys are blocking my way.

197
00:10:42,140 --> 00:10:42,835
Hey.

198
00:10:42,835 --> 00:10:44,282
Your room is that way.

199
00:10:44,282 --> 00:10:45,126
Go.

200
00:10:45,126 --> 00:10:46,789
I'm not close with my roommate yet.

201
00:10:46,789 --> 00:10:48,407
You will be soon.

202
00:10:48,911 --> 00:10:49,728
Hey!

203
00:10:49,728 --> 00:10:51,473
I'm going to sleep here.

204
00:10:54,566 --> 00:10:56,587
I promise I won't snore.

205
00:10:56,587 --> 00:10:57,214
I don't believe you.

206
00:10:57,214 --> 00:10:57,765
Me neither.

207
00:10:57,765 --> 00:10:58,479
Just go!

208
00:10:58,479 --> 00:10:58,979
Come on!

209
00:10:58,979 --> 00:10:59,844
Are you guys really my friends?

210
00:11:05,274 --> 00:11:08,973
May I have the next freshy on stage?

211
00:11:09,431 --> 00:11:11,112
Sand, get your hands off me.

212
00:11:11,685 --> 00:11:12,919
Who do you want as your peer mentor?

213
00:11:13,056 --> 00:11:13,965
I don't know.

214
00:11:14,263 --> 00:11:14,890
What about you?

215
00:11:15,325 --> 00:11:16,084
Me?

216
00:11:17,482 --> 00:11:18,819
That senior with a bun.

217
00:11:18,819 --> 00:11:20,441
I think she's my type.

218
00:11:21,953 --> 00:11:22,480
Cute.

219
00:11:24,000 --> 00:11:25,396
Slap. Slap.

220
00:11:25,579 --> 00:11:26,644
Why the hell did you slap me, Po?

221
00:11:26,644 --> 00:11:28,089
You're not supposed to find a partner,

222
00:11:28,433 --> 00:11:29,623
but a peer mentor group to join.

223
00:11:29,623 --> 00:11:30,875
Yeah, Sand, he's right.

224
00:11:30,875 --> 00:11:31,738
You're just as bad.

225
00:11:32,105 --> 00:11:33,940
You guys in this line, please stand up.

226
00:11:44,776 --> 00:11:45,466
Hi.

227
00:11:49,109 --> 00:11:52,151
I'm Anon Phuwakomol.

228
00:11:52,151 --> 00:11:53,423
My nickname is Arm.

229
00:11:53,760 --> 00:11:56,340
Please go ahead and draw lots.

230
00:12:09,766 --> 00:12:10,360
Here.

231
00:12:13,017 --> 00:12:16,426
Alright, Arm,
your peer mentor's code is

232
00:12:18,000 --> 00:12:22,074
0498.

233
00:12:25,680 --> 00:12:26,474
Yes!

234
00:12:28,719 --> 00:12:30,816
Is that the Perfect 10 Liners?

235
00:12:31,503 --> 00:12:32,901
They just keep winning.

236
00:12:33,199 --> 00:12:34,000
Arm!

237
00:12:42,247 --> 00:12:43,225
Hey, Arm.

238
00:12:44,640 --> 00:12:47,558
Welcome to Perfect 10 Liners.

239
00:12:51,120 --> 00:12:52,922
You remember me, right?

240
00:12:52,922 --> 00:12:53,921
I do.

241
00:12:54,120 --> 00:12:55,109
What a small world.

242
00:12:57,858 --> 00:13:01,656
Here's a gift from me
and Jet, our 4th-year senior.

243
00:13:08,689 --> 00:13:09,738
You get this too.

244
00:13:11,204 --> 00:13:11,882
Open it.

245
00:13:17,816 --> 00:13:18,863
A tile grout?

246
00:13:19,550 --> 00:13:20,741
From your 3rd-year senior.

247
00:13:33,439 --> 00:13:35,342
My first day was already chaotic.

248
00:13:39,825 --> 00:13:44,234
Pun, why are we called Perfect 10 Liners?

249
00:13:44,486 --> 00:13:46,889
Because we have perfect faces.

250
00:13:51,173 --> 00:13:52,739
Do I have a perfect face?

251
00:13:57,687 --> 00:13:58,804
Just kidding.

252
00:13:58,804 --> 00:14:01,629
There are just many coincidences.

253
00:14:02,065 --> 00:14:04,438
Soon, you'll find out.

254
00:14:06,000 --> 00:14:06,639
Ah.

255
00:14:07,520 --> 00:14:08,814
Oh, by the way,

256
00:14:08,997 --> 00:14:10,964
the photo I took of you and posted on the page

257
00:14:11,147 --> 00:14:13,042
got over a thousand likes.

258
00:14:14,462 --> 00:14:16,039
That many?

259
00:14:16,176 --> 00:14:16,884
Yes.

260
00:14:16,884 --> 00:14:18,728
I ran an ad on it.

261
00:14:18,728 --> 00:14:19,692
Oh.

262
00:14:21,067 --> 00:14:22,330
Look at that face.

263
00:14:22,765 --> 00:14:25,295
You don't know the Engineer Cute Boy page, do you?

264
00:14:27,586 --> 00:14:29,716
Let me tell you about it.

265
00:14:36,400 --> 00:14:38,229
HERE'S THE USERNAME AND PASSWORD FOR THE PAGE.

266
00:14:39,960 --> 00:14:43,187
I promised myself that before I step down,

267
00:14:43,577 --> 00:14:47,268
I'd teach my peer mentee
to take over the page admin role.

268
00:14:47,520 --> 00:14:50,749
Luckily,
you joined us in the Perfect 10 Liners.

269
00:14:51,551 --> 00:14:54,322
So, please help me.

270
00:14:55,353 --> 00:14:56,345
Well,

271
00:14:56,803 --> 00:14:58,184
Please.

272
00:14:58,184 --> 00:15:01,435
We only have hundreds of thousands of followers.

273
00:15:01,435 --> 00:15:02,313
It's not hard.

274
00:15:07,239 --> 00:15:08,183
It shouldn't be hard.

275
00:15:14,850 --> 00:15:16,776
YOU HAVE A NEW NOTIFICATION.
YOU HAVE A NEW NOTIFICATION.

276
00:15:17,280 --> 00:15:20,003
Damn!

277
00:15:20,759 --> 00:15:21,792
What's going on?

278
00:15:25,183 --> 00:15:28,167
ADMIN, PLEASE POST A PHOTO OF ARC
FROM ENGINEERING.

279
00:15:28,167 --> 00:15:29,017
I HAVEN'T SEEN YOU POST HIM.

280
00:15:29,017 --> 00:15:31,280
HE'S THE HOTTEST!!!

281
00:15:33,200 --> 00:15:34,332
Arc from Engineering?

282
00:15:36,000 --> 00:15:37,150
Who's that?

283
00:15:45,237 --> 00:15:46,496
What do I have to do?

284
00:15:46,931 --> 00:15:50,329
If anyone suggests a hot Engineering guy,

285
00:15:50,329 --> 00:15:51,797
you just post his photo

286
00:15:51,797 --> 00:15:53,569
and write a little caption.

287
00:15:54,000 --> 00:15:57,184
Does this mean you agree to do it?

288
00:15:57,367 --> 00:16:00,282
Well…

289
00:16:01,198 --> 00:16:04,895
But one guy is an exception.

290
00:16:05,399 --> 00:16:07,157
You cannot post him.

291
00:16:07,730 --> 00:16:08,858
Oh?

292
00:16:10,759 --> 00:16:11,753
I cannot…?

293
00:16:13,380 --> 00:16:14,682
I cannot do what?

294
00:16:15,530 --> 00:16:16,516
Whatever.

295
00:16:17,524 --> 00:16:18,541
I'll just post this photo.

296
00:16:18,541 --> 00:16:22,904
LET'S HIT THE FIELD.
#HOTFOOTBALLPLAYERSPOTTED
/ADMIN A.

297
00:16:27,936 --> 00:16:28,792
Come on!

298
00:16:28,880 --> 00:16:29,882
Go!

299
00:16:31,760 --> 00:16:32,620
Hey!

300
00:16:38,078 --> 00:16:38,578
Arc!

301
00:16:39,218 --> 00:16:39,732
Warm!

302
00:16:42,131 --> 00:16:43,529
Strike a goal!

303
00:16:44,569 --> 00:16:45,622
Yes!

304
00:16:45,622 --> 00:16:46,662
Woo!

305
00:16:49,720 --> 00:16:50,335
Woo!

306
00:16:56,033 --> 00:16:56,533
Here.

307
00:16:57,033 --> 00:16:57,611
Thank you.

308
00:17:01,789 --> 00:17:03,003
Oh, shit. Look at this.

309
00:17:05,082 --> 00:17:05,792
Shit.

310
00:17:06,752 --> 00:17:08,096
Pond. Copp. What's wrong?

311
00:17:08,796 --> 00:17:10,048
Your faces look as if someone died.

312
00:17:11,168 --> 00:17:12,445
If they're not dead, they're almost dead.

313
00:17:13,185 --> 00:17:13,685
Look.

314
00:17:15,084 --> 00:17:16,114
Arc, have you seen this?

315
00:17:39,603 --> 00:17:40,625
Damn.

316
00:17:42,644 --> 00:17:43,646
This guy is so popular.

317
00:17:45,465 --> 00:17:47,055
PLEASE DELETE MY PHOTO FROM THE PAGE.

318
00:17:47,155 --> 00:17:48,268
I DIDN'T GIVE YOU PERMISSION TO POST IT.

319
00:17:58,004 --> 00:18:01,173
I'M SORRY I DIDN'T ASK FOR PERMISSION.

320
00:18:01,294 --> 00:18:02,965
I WANT TO PROTECT MY PRIVACY.

321
00:18:03,065 --> 00:18:06,108
I DON'T WANT ANYONE TO PUBLISH MY PHOTOS
OR CRITICIZE ME.

322
00:18:06,648 --> 00:18:07,421
Damn.

323
00:18:08,900 --> 00:18:10,097
Why is he so angry?

324
00:18:11,256 --> 00:18:12,433
DELETE IT RIGHT NOW.

325
00:18:13,852 --> 00:18:14,521
DELETE IT!!!!!!!

326
00:18:14,761 --> 00:18:15,813
I SAID DELETE IT!!!!

327
00:18:16,040 --> 00:18:17,780
They should know better than to mess with Arc.

328
00:18:17,940 --> 00:18:20,262
DELETE IT!!!!!!!
Fine, I'll delete it!

329
00:18:20,262 --> 00:18:21,070
DELETE IT!!!!!!!
Damn it!

330
00:18:35,624 --> 00:18:36,565
What a jerk.

331
00:18:42,202 --> 00:18:43,953
We're back.

332
00:18:44,280 --> 00:18:46,143
Hey, Perfect 10 Liners member.

333
00:18:46,263 --> 00:18:47,699
When you're famous, don't forget me.

334
00:18:49,958 --> 00:18:51,072
Hey, Sand.

335
00:18:51,072 --> 00:18:51,633
Hmm?

336
00:18:52,593 --> 00:18:56,086
Is Perfect 10 Liners really that big?

337
00:18:56,086 --> 00:18:57,624
Whoa.

338
00:18:58,004 --> 00:18:59,446
You really don't know anything.

339
00:18:59,706 --> 00:19:02,701
Their good looks carry on
from generation to generation.

340
00:19:03,181 --> 00:19:04,935
But now that it's reached you,

341
00:19:06,135 --> 00:19:07,703
it may have dropped a bit.

342
00:19:08,902 --> 00:19:09,786
Damn, Po.

343
00:19:09,786 --> 00:19:10,286
What?

344
00:19:10,566 --> 00:19:11,178
Are you picking on me?

345
00:19:11,178 --> 00:19:11,980
I'm not.

346
00:19:12,660 --> 00:19:13,228
Seriously.

347
00:19:13,560 --> 00:19:14,953
Listen, guys.

348
00:19:14,953 --> 00:19:15,453
Yeah?

349
00:19:15,713 --> 00:19:16,787
Let me tell you something.

350
00:19:16,787 --> 00:19:17,287
Okay.

351
00:19:17,287 --> 00:19:18,674
What era are we in?

352
00:19:18,674 --> 00:19:21,641
Looking good and dressing well means nothing.

353
00:19:21,781 --> 00:19:25,613
You know,
I stopped judging people based on that a long time ago.

354
00:19:26,293 --> 00:19:29,346
You two should start doing the same.

355
00:19:29,706 --> 00:19:30,484
How cool.

356
00:19:31,024 --> 00:19:31,957
That's deep.

357
00:19:31,957 --> 00:19:33,007
That's on point.

358
00:19:33,407 --> 00:19:34,568
That's so on point.

359
00:19:34,928 --> 00:19:35,844
Listen.

360
00:19:35,844 --> 00:19:36,476
Okay.

361
00:19:36,520 --> 00:19:41,739
About my seemingly perfect peer mentoring group,
Pun said it's all in people's heads.

362
00:19:45,697 --> 00:19:46,661
Damn it.

363
00:19:47,721 --> 00:19:49,285
Who does he think he is?

364
00:19:49,945 --> 00:19:51,943
Does he think he can just talk shit to anyone?

365
00:19:52,603 --> 00:19:53,914
He looks…

366
00:19:57,352 --> 00:19:58,021
He looks good.

367
00:19:58,941 --> 00:19:59,880
But so what?

368
00:20:00,680 --> 00:20:02,859
Being good-looking but foul-mouthed
doesn't make it okay.

369
00:20:03,719 --> 00:20:05,562
Look, I'm sorry.

370
00:20:06,182 --> 00:20:07,715
You didn't have to scold me that harshly.

371
00:20:08,834 --> 00:20:10,942
Anyway, don't compliment me like that again

372
00:20:12,141 --> 00:20:13,361
or I'll get shy.

373
00:20:13,361 --> 00:20:14,267
So handsome!

374
00:20:14,267 --> 00:20:14,768
What?

375
00:20:15,588 --> 00:20:16,200
That's not me?

376
00:20:16,420 --> 00:20:17,517
So what if he's handsome?

377
00:20:17,817 --> 00:20:18,772
He's such a…

378
00:20:18,772 --> 00:20:19,391
Bad boy.

379
00:20:20,510 --> 00:20:21,968
As expected of his “beyond the star” title.

380
00:20:23,040 --> 00:20:24,520
Look at these bulky muscles.

381
00:20:24,998 --> 00:20:25,753
Bulky for sure.

382
00:20:25,753 --> 00:20:28,931
Sand, what's “beyond the star”?

383
00:20:32,760 --> 00:20:34,448
It means more handsome than the star.

384
00:20:34,448 --> 00:20:36,560
Arc is more handsome than the campus star.

385
00:20:36,560 --> 00:20:38,561
So people call him “beyond the star”.

386
00:20:40,660 --> 00:20:41,906
If he really were more handsome than the campus star,

387
00:20:42,066 --> 00:20:43,503
he'd have won the title, right?

388
00:20:44,063 --> 00:20:46,193
Arc prefers peace

389
00:20:46,193 --> 00:20:47,140
so he didn't join the contest.

390
00:20:47,840 --> 00:20:48,611
Ugh.

391
00:20:49,231 --> 00:20:51,299
Does he think acting mysterious makes him look cool?

392
00:20:51,299 --> 00:20:53,778
Hey, enough about him.

393
00:20:53,778 --> 00:20:55,677
What have you done?

394
00:20:56,717 --> 00:20:59,205
I've been meaning to talk to you.

395
00:20:59,745 --> 00:21:02,110
I don't think I'm fit to manage the page.

396
00:21:02,110 --> 00:21:03,871
Oh, about that.

397
00:21:04,511 --> 00:21:05,789
I get it, Arm.

398
00:21:06,229 --> 00:21:06,896
Well, then.

399
00:21:06,896 --> 00:21:07,680
But you'll get used to it.

400
00:21:08,919 --> 00:21:10,387
Just don't post any photos of Arc

401
00:21:10,527 --> 00:21:12,131
and you'll be fine.

402
00:21:12,131 --> 00:21:13,013
Trust me.

403
00:21:14,752 --> 00:21:15,252
But…

404
00:21:15,252 --> 00:21:16,134
Stop it.

405
00:21:16,434 --> 00:21:18,373
I didn't ask you here to talk about this.

406
00:21:19,153 --> 00:21:19,681
Oh?

407
00:21:20,281 --> 00:21:23,972
I heard some seniors
tried to convince you to compete for campus star.

408
00:21:24,172 --> 00:21:25,411
Why did you say no?

409
00:21:26,171 --> 00:21:28,300
I don't think I'm suitable for that.

410
00:21:28,460 --> 00:21:29,769
Why not?

411
00:21:29,769 --> 00:21:31,222
You're so handsome, Arm.

412
00:21:31,482 --> 00:21:34,307
The seniors say you're the most suitable.

413
00:21:35,367 --> 00:21:37,876
But I don't think I am.

414
00:21:37,876 --> 00:21:40,436
You're just like Arc, you know?

415
00:21:40,756 --> 00:21:41,366
Huh?

416
00:21:42,020 --> 00:21:44,048
Jet told me that back then

417
00:21:44,048 --> 00:21:47,680
the seniors tried to convince Arc
to compete for campus star too,

418
00:21:47,680 --> 00:21:48,272
but he said no.

419
00:21:49,171 --> 00:21:51,294
You're acting exactly like him now.

420
00:21:56,832 --> 00:21:58,210
Hey, guys.

421
00:21:58,210 --> 00:21:58,801
Hey.

422
00:21:59,581 --> 00:22:00,297
Have a seat.

423
00:22:03,276 --> 00:22:06,012
This is Jet, the 4th-year senior in our group.

424
00:22:06,520 --> 00:22:07,257
He's my boyfriend.

425
00:22:08,536 --> 00:22:09,202
Hi.

426
00:22:09,402 --> 00:22:10,156
Hi.

427
00:22:11,515 --> 00:22:13,880
Feel free to order anything you want.

428
00:22:13,880 --> 00:22:14,722
Don't hold back.

429
00:22:14,722 --> 00:22:15,761
It's my treat.

430
00:22:16,001 --> 00:22:17,853
Isn't he generous?

431
00:22:20,232 --> 00:22:21,721
Hey, Pun, where's…

432
00:22:22,001 --> 00:22:23,627
Sorry. I just finished my football practice.

433
00:22:29,404 --> 00:22:30,068
Shit!

434
00:22:30,168 --> 00:22:30,822
Shit!

435
00:22:30,902 --> 00:22:31,447
Shit!

436
00:22:33,146 --> 00:22:34,364
What the hell?

437
00:22:34,364 --> 00:22:35,462
I'm sorry.

438
00:22:37,381 --> 00:22:40,827
Why didn't you tell me Arc is in our group?

439
00:22:41,107 --> 00:22:42,464
I thought you knew.

440
00:22:43,663 --> 00:22:44,721
I'm sorry.

441
00:22:44,721 --> 00:22:46,379
Just sit properly and stop being annoying.

442
00:22:51,877 --> 00:22:52,439
Pun.

443
00:22:52,439 --> 00:22:53,173
Yes?

444
00:22:53,393 --> 00:22:55,066
Have you got any updates for me?

445
00:22:55,066 --> 00:22:58,944
About the page admin?

446
00:22:59,484 --> 00:23:00,341
Oh, shit!

447
00:23:00,341 --> 00:23:01,606
When I find them,

448
00:23:03,000 --> 00:23:04,753
I'm going to beat the crap out of them.

449
00:23:04,993 --> 00:23:08,416
Take it easy, bro.

450
00:23:08,556 --> 00:23:10,810
The junior probably didn't mean it.

451
00:23:11,690 --> 00:23:12,546
The junior?

452
00:23:14,085 --> 00:23:14,766
Uh…

453
00:23:16,280 --> 00:23:17,118
The uncle.

454
00:23:17,298 --> 00:23:18,760
It could be an uncle or an auntie.

455
00:23:18,760 --> 00:23:19,530
I don't know.

456
00:23:19,530 --> 00:23:21,239
It's probably an uncle.

457
00:23:21,239 --> 00:23:22,339
I don't know.

458
00:23:23,059 --> 00:23:24,911
Whatever. Just wait till I find them.

459
00:23:25,080 --> 00:23:26,598
I'm going to smash their face.

460
00:23:28,057 --> 00:23:30,030
Hey, calm down.

461
00:23:30,190 --> 00:23:32,173
You're scaring him. Look.

462
00:23:35,172 --> 00:23:36,197
Are you cold, Arm?

463
00:23:36,520 --> 00:23:37,993
Uh, yes.

464
00:23:39,033 --> 00:23:40,529
I mean, no.

465
00:23:43,008 --> 00:23:43,944
I'll be right back.

466
00:23:43,944 --> 00:23:44,655
I'm going to the restroom.

467
00:23:45,575 --> 00:23:46,098
Oh.

468
00:23:53,894 --> 00:23:55,063
That's just who Arc is.

469
00:23:55,483 --> 00:23:56,400
He's foul-mouthed

470
00:23:57,140 --> 00:23:58,003
but he's actually kind.

471
00:23:59,500 --> 00:24:00,258
Really?

472
00:24:01,060 --> 00:24:01,890
Right, babe?

473
00:24:01,890 --> 00:24:02,390
Yeah.

474
00:24:02,570 --> 00:24:03,690
That's right.

475
00:24:11,167 --> 00:24:12,293
I'm happy.

476
00:24:12,293 --> 00:24:15,336
I think you'll get along with us really well.

477
00:24:16,715 --> 00:24:17,255
Yeah.

478
00:24:17,635 --> 00:24:19,689
If you need any help, just let us know.

479
00:24:20,089 --> 00:24:24,329
We're a tight-knit group.

480
00:24:25,528 --> 00:24:26,502
I will, Jet.

481
00:24:26,680 --> 00:24:27,651
I have to go.

482
00:24:27,651 --> 00:24:28,962
Bye, Jet. Bye, Pun.

483
00:24:30,241 --> 00:24:31,202
And what's your name again?

484
00:24:33,841 --> 00:24:36,139
His name is Arm.

485
00:24:36,659 --> 00:24:38,598
Arc and Arm.

486
00:24:38,738 --> 00:24:39,830
Arm and Arc.

487
00:24:39,830 --> 00:24:41,234
Your names sound similar.

488
00:24:41,454 --> 00:24:43,450
Your first names are also similar.

489
00:24:43,450 --> 00:24:44,325
Yours is Anon, isn't it?

490
00:24:44,325 --> 00:24:45,008
It's Anon.

491
00:24:45,008 --> 00:24:46,617
And yours is Anol, right?

492
00:24:46,617 --> 00:24:47,117
Really?

493
00:24:49,176 --> 00:24:51,502
Do they have similar meanings?

494
00:24:51,842 --> 00:24:54,636
What does your name mean again?

495
00:24:56,215 --> 00:24:57,419
Well, it means,

496
00:24:59,338 --> 00:25:00,463
a person who has no debt.

497
00:25:00,463 --> 00:25:03,120
Oh, a person who has no debt.

498
00:25:03,120 --> 00:25:03,853
Why are you laughing?

499
00:25:05,672 --> 00:25:06,950
Our names are similar,

500
00:25:07,390 --> 00:25:08,571
so their meanings should be similar too, right?

501
00:25:09,131 --> 00:25:11,866
My name means God of Fire.

502
00:25:12,520 --> 00:25:13,136
God of Fire.

503
00:25:17,054 --> 00:25:17,905
Thanks for this.

504
00:25:21,224 --> 00:25:22,053
Keep it.

505
00:25:22,393 --> 00:25:24,080
I don't like wearing anything after anyone.

506
00:25:26,039 --> 00:25:26,911
I can't stand the perfume.

507
00:25:29,110 --> 00:25:29,610
But…

508
00:25:29,610 --> 00:25:31,383
And I don't like anyone who talks back.

509
00:25:34,502 --> 00:25:35,243
Sure.

510
00:25:35,403 --> 00:25:36,168
Hey.

511
00:25:36,720 --> 00:25:38,843
You're going to your condo, right, Arc?

512
00:25:39,883 --> 00:25:41,099
You'll be passing the university.

513
00:25:41,239 --> 00:25:42,572
Please give Arm a ride.

514
00:25:42,972 --> 00:25:44,279
It's okay, Pun.

515
00:25:44,279 --> 00:25:47,596
I don't want my perfume to stick to his car.

516
00:25:47,596 --> 00:25:48,949
You're getting on my nerves.

517
00:25:51,308 --> 00:25:53,230
Have you heard of the saying,

518
00:25:53,230 --> 00:25:55,482
“the most dangerous place is the safest one?”

519
00:25:55,482 --> 00:25:56,880
Go with him.

520
00:25:57,140 --> 00:25:57,966
But, Pun.

521
00:25:58,586 --> 00:25:59,930
Please give him a ride.

522
00:26:00,010 --> 00:26:00,623
No.

523
00:26:00,883 --> 00:26:01,834
I just had my car washed.

524
00:26:02,154 --> 00:26:02,953
I'm leaving.

525
00:26:11,749 --> 00:26:13,488
We're a tight-knit group, huh, Jet?

526
00:26:13,680 --> 00:26:15,145
You guys will bond over time.

527
00:26:15,145 --> 00:26:16,447
Don't worry.

528
00:26:20,880 --> 00:26:21,750
Damn it!

529
00:26:21,750 --> 00:26:23,900
I'm so freaking pissed!

530
00:26:23,900 --> 00:26:25,855
Hey, you're back.

531
00:26:25,855 --> 00:26:27,122
Do you want to play this game with me?

532
00:26:27,122 --> 00:26:28,472
I'm so pissed!

533
00:26:28,572 --> 00:26:30,112
He's freaking foul-mouthed!

534
00:26:30,112 --> 00:26:31,824
Asshole!

535
00:26:31,824 --> 00:26:32,851
Foul-mouthed idiot!

536
00:26:34,230 --> 00:26:35,443
As if his shirt smells good!

537
00:26:35,603 --> 00:26:37,275
It freaking stinks!

538
00:26:37,355 --> 00:26:37,900
Damn it!

539
00:26:39,219 --> 00:26:40,404
I'm so pissed!

540
00:26:45,662 --> 00:26:46,400
Po!

541
00:26:48,520 --> 00:26:50,185
Po! Are you okay?

542
00:26:50,185 --> 00:26:51,224
Breathe! Are you okay?

543
00:26:51,224 --> 00:26:51,840
Breathe!

544
00:26:51,840 --> 00:26:52,592
Breathe!

545
00:26:54,231 --> 00:26:56,188
Po!

546
00:27:01,245 --> 00:27:01,948
This one is good.

547
00:27:02,868 --> 00:27:03,836
Go ahead.

548
00:27:06,695 --> 00:27:07,388
Hey, Arm!

549
00:27:07,688 --> 00:27:08,620
She's calling me.

550
00:27:08,620 --> 00:27:09,220
Hey!

551
00:27:09,220 --> 00:27:10,180
No, she's calling Arm.

552
00:27:10,180 --> 00:27:10,867
Sorry.

553
00:27:12,346 --> 00:27:14,366
I thought you were going to say no to this.

554
00:27:16,505 --> 00:27:18,440
Well, I changed my mind.

555
00:27:19,220 --> 00:27:20,037
Why?

556
00:27:20,837 --> 00:27:22,023
I have my reasons.

557
00:27:22,903 --> 00:27:23,731
What's with the harsh tone?

558
00:27:23,871 --> 00:27:24,437
I have to go.

559
00:27:24,437 --> 00:27:25,262
Alright, do your best.

560
00:27:25,262 --> 00:27:26,207
Cheer me on.

561
00:27:27,087 --> 00:27:28,546
He wants us to cheer for him.

562
00:27:28,706 --> 00:27:29,678
Let's each carry a sign.

563
00:27:30,637 --> 00:27:31,520
Thank you.

564
00:27:31,520 --> 00:27:33,123
Next, please.

565
00:27:37,261 --> 00:27:39,843
Hi. I'm A-ngun Arisara Metasiri.

566
00:27:39,843 --> 00:27:41,825
Civil Engineering major.

567
00:27:44,784 --> 00:27:46,242
Next, please.

568
00:27:47,401 --> 00:27:51,200
Woo!

569
00:27:51,200 --> 00:27:52,036
That's my friend!

570
00:27:52,036 --> 00:27:52,723
Go, buddy!

571
00:27:52,723 --> 00:27:53,539
You're so handsome!

572
00:27:54,520 --> 00:27:55,072
Sorry.

573
00:27:58,550 --> 00:27:59,103
Hi.

574
00:28:00,063 --> 00:28:02,445
I'm Arm Anon Phuwakomol.

575
00:28:02,445 --> 00:28:03,799
Representative from Electrical Engineering.

576
00:28:05,960 --> 00:28:07,287
He's my friend!

577
00:28:07,440 --> 00:28:08,255
Arm!

578
00:28:09,794 --> 00:28:10,294
What?

579
00:28:10,874 --> 00:28:12,040
Turn around.

580
00:28:12,192 --> 00:28:12,848
What are you saying?

581
00:28:19,145 --> 00:28:20,056
Oh, okay.

582
00:28:20,056 --> 00:28:21,215
Turn around.

583
00:28:39,987 --> 00:28:41,032
Arm!

584
00:28:43,351 --> 00:28:44,983
Po, my leg!

585
00:28:47,002 --> 00:28:47,652
Does it hurt?

586
00:28:48,080 --> 00:28:49,107
Does it hurt?

587
00:29:04,091 --> 00:29:04,808
Hey!

588
00:29:06,471 --> 00:29:08,352
I just fell off a stage, not a building.

589
00:29:08,352 --> 00:29:08,958
You're right.

590
00:29:08,958 --> 00:29:09,637
Yeah.

591
00:29:10,233 --> 00:29:11,719
Are you okay?

592
00:29:12,496 --> 00:29:13,230
I'm fine.

593
00:29:13,646 --> 00:29:15,206
Just a bruise on my knee.

594
00:29:15,206 --> 00:29:16,432
Is my friend's knee okay?

595
00:29:16,432 --> 00:29:17,705
Po! Sand!

596
00:29:17,705 --> 00:29:18,415
Is it broken?

597
00:29:19,131 --> 00:29:19,886
Ouch!

598
00:29:20,562 --> 00:29:21,225
My bruise!

599
00:29:21,225 --> 00:29:21,725
Is it broken?

600
00:29:21,725 --> 00:29:22,439
Ouch!

601
00:29:26,037 --> 00:29:26,707
How's that?

602
00:29:27,900 --> 00:29:28,915
Damn it.

603
00:29:29,620 --> 00:29:30,852
My knee isn't broken.

604
00:29:31,931 --> 00:29:34,754
But my face is in pieces.

605
00:29:37,881 --> 00:29:38,604
Pun.

606
00:29:38,604 --> 00:29:39,209
Yeah?

607
00:29:39,534 --> 00:29:40,825
Do I still have to compete?

608
00:29:43,320 --> 00:29:44,582
Oh, you don't have to.

609
00:29:44,835 --> 00:29:45,582
Why not?

610
00:29:46,161 --> 00:29:47,499
They don't think I have potential anymore?

611
00:29:48,114 --> 00:29:49,022
It's not that.

612
00:29:49,771 --> 00:29:50,367
Are you done?

613
00:30:02,371 --> 00:30:03,018
Pun,

614
00:30:03,691 --> 00:30:05,440
I can actually get a ride with my friends.

615
00:30:05,765 --> 00:30:07,081
You didn't have to bother Arc.

616
00:30:07,081 --> 00:30:08,853
Three people on one bike is dangerous.

617
00:30:08,998 --> 00:30:10,160
Go with Arc.

618
00:30:10,938 --> 00:30:11,793
But, Pun.

619
00:30:11,793 --> 00:30:13,836
Don't worry about being the page admin.

620
00:30:13,836 --> 00:30:15,828
If you and I don't say anything,

621
00:30:16,081 --> 00:30:17,252
Arc isn't going to find out.

622
00:30:18,211 --> 00:30:19,307
Come on.

623
00:30:19,669 --> 00:30:20,501
Don't act suspicious.

624
00:30:21,387 --> 00:30:22,228
Just go.

625
00:30:22,770 --> 00:30:23,710
Ride with Arc.

626
00:30:28,121 --> 00:30:28,954
Please take care of him.

627
00:30:29,948 --> 00:30:30,599
Safe trip.

628
00:30:31,322 --> 00:30:31,968
See you.

629
00:30:39,003 --> 00:30:39,543
Hey.

630
00:30:39,941 --> 00:30:41,539
Do you think that by staring at my face,

631
00:30:41,864 --> 00:30:44,122
you'll magically fly into my car?

632
00:30:48,117 --> 00:30:48,994
Seriously, Arc?

633
00:30:49,374 --> 00:30:51,095
I was going to thank you,

634
00:30:51,167 --> 00:30:53,418
but now I take it back.

635
00:30:53,418 --> 00:30:54,595
If you don't want to do this,

636
00:30:54,595 --> 00:30:56,127
I can get a ride with my friends.

637
00:30:56,543 --> 00:30:57,193
Let's go, Po!

638
00:30:58,440 --> 00:30:58,940
Hey!

639
00:30:58,940 --> 00:30:59,926
- Damn it, Po!
- See you, Arm!

640
00:31:00,251 --> 00:31:00,757
Sand!

641
00:31:00,757 --> 00:31:01,341
Po!

642
00:31:01,576 --> 00:31:02,682
See you?

643
00:31:02,682 --> 00:31:04,133
Po! What about me?

644
00:31:06,628 --> 00:31:07,128
Damn it!

645
00:31:26,273 --> 00:31:27,672
Try staring at my face a little longer.

646
00:31:34,433 --> 00:31:35,812
Maybe you'll be able to fly into my car.

647
00:31:39,500 --> 00:31:43,427
Aren't you worried my perfume will stick to your car seat?

648
00:32:18,956 --> 00:32:19,881
You're not wearing your perfume today.

649
00:32:28,613 --> 00:32:30,678
How much longer are you going to stand there?

650
00:32:47,616 --> 00:32:48,211
Wait.

651
00:32:51,230 --> 00:32:53,736
I gave you a ride just to keep the tradition.

652
00:32:54,495 --> 00:32:56,328
Our group always takes care of each other like this.

653
00:32:57,593 --> 00:32:58,093
Right.

654
00:32:59,069 --> 00:33:00,215
I guess I'm not used to it yet.

655
00:33:02,493 --> 00:33:05,401
If you don't want to owe me anything,

656
00:33:05,889 --> 00:33:07,575
just find a way to return the favor.

657
00:33:07,864 --> 00:33:08,703
I didn't ask you to give me a ride.

658
00:33:08,703 --> 00:33:13,567
Look into the Engineer Cute Boy admin
and find out who they are.

659
00:33:14,290 --> 00:33:15,387
Oh,

660
00:33:17,454 --> 00:33:19,482
why do you want to know so much?

661
00:33:20,079 --> 00:33:21,781
You should learn to let it go.

662
00:33:21,781 --> 00:33:22,544
Stop asking questions.

663
00:33:24,406 --> 00:33:26,001
Once we find that person,

664
00:33:30,683 --> 00:33:32,180
you must help me deal with them.

665
00:33:35,741 --> 00:33:36,615
Of course.

666
00:33:37,862 --> 00:33:38,710
I have to go.

667
00:33:39,035 --> 00:33:39,903
Bye.

668
00:33:48,075 --> 00:33:48,752
What's he so afraid of?

669
00:33:54,411 --> 00:33:55,261
One here.

670
00:33:55,623 --> 00:33:56,456
I'm going to put this here.

671
00:33:56,456 --> 00:33:58,287
59.

672
00:33:58,721 --> 00:33:59,615
Hey, Arc.

673
00:34:00,374 --> 00:34:01,618
Where have you been?

674
00:34:01,618 --> 00:34:03,138
It's not fun playing this with just the three of us.

675
00:34:03,644 --> 00:34:05,269
Come and join us.

676
00:34:07,493 --> 00:34:08,071
What's up?

677
00:34:09,731 --> 00:34:10,480
Is everything alright?

678
00:34:16,518 --> 00:34:17,998
Hey, guys.

679
00:34:17,998 --> 00:34:19,538
I want my keycard back.

680
00:34:20,026 --> 00:34:22,128
Next time you want to come over,
just give me a heads-up.

681
00:34:23,792 --> 00:34:24,637
Are you serious?

682
00:34:26,517 --> 00:34:27,115
Yeah.

683
00:34:27,211 --> 00:34:27,711
What?

684
00:34:28,000 --> 00:34:29,902
You said we could make ourselves at home here.

685
00:34:30,137 --> 00:34:30,808
Yeah.

686
00:34:33,050 --> 00:34:34,029
Come on, guys.

687
00:34:34,372 --> 00:34:36,068
It's not often that he finds what he likes.

688
00:34:36,068 --> 00:34:38,598
Let our friend get his room ready.

689
00:34:41,382 --> 00:34:42,402
What?

690
00:34:45,150 --> 00:34:45,796
Damn it!

691
00:34:46,501 --> 00:34:47,905
I'm so freaking pissed!

692
00:34:48,429 --> 00:34:50,875
What makes Arc think he's so handsome and cool?

693
00:34:51,218 --> 00:34:51,979
Asshole.

694
00:34:52,447 --> 00:34:53,698
I wish I could just punch his face once.

695
00:34:53,698 --> 00:34:54,198
Careful.

696
00:34:54,921 --> 00:34:56,732
You might just end up with what you hate.

697
00:34:56,732 --> 00:34:57,232
Yeah.

698
00:34:58,805 --> 00:34:59,596
I definitely will.

699
00:35:02,399 --> 00:35:04,586
I definitely will end up punching his face one day.

700
00:35:04,586 --> 00:35:06,446
Whoa, what a thug.

701
00:35:06,591 --> 00:35:08,649
Let's talk about you being the page admin.

702
00:35:09,047 --> 00:35:10,808
How long do you think you can hide it from Arc?

703
00:35:13,014 --> 00:35:14,317
I'll hide until the day I die.

704
00:35:14,932 --> 00:35:16,684
I'm just his peer mentee's mentee,

705
00:35:16,865 --> 00:35:18,297
but he's bullying me this much.

706
00:35:19,147 --> 00:35:21,167
If he finds out I posted his photo,

707
00:35:21,800 --> 00:35:23,012
won't he kill me?

708
00:35:23,012 --> 00:35:25,356
Come on. Killing people is a sin.

709
00:35:25,464 --> 00:35:26,737
Arc won't do that.

710
00:35:26,900 --> 00:35:27,981
Seriously, Po?

711
00:35:27,981 --> 00:35:28,597
What?

712
00:35:28,597 --> 00:35:30,585
You're my friend,
but you never take my side.

713
00:35:30,585 --> 00:35:33,120
Yeah. How could you side with someone else?

714
00:35:33,120 --> 00:35:33,687
What?

715
00:35:34,012 --> 00:35:36,961
Even though Arc is more handsome,

716
00:35:37,557 --> 00:35:38,626
He's more handsome, you know.

717
00:35:38,626 --> 00:35:39,229
Cooler.

718
00:35:39,229 --> 00:35:40,249
Cooler, too.

719
00:35:40,629 --> 00:35:41,379
Taller.

720
00:35:41,379 --> 00:35:42,232
Wow, he's tall.

721
00:35:42,232 --> 00:35:42,935
More importantly,

722
00:35:43,297 --> 00:35:44,144
he's smarter.

723
00:35:46,171 --> 00:35:47,072
Damn it!

724
00:35:47,831 --> 00:35:50,904
Arc, you think you're so cool, huh?

725
00:35:51,229 --> 00:35:55,074
Please! I hope I never see you again in this life.

726
00:35:55,526 --> 00:35:56,450
Amen!

727
00:36:00,625 --> 00:36:01,198
Get in the car.

728
00:36:03,211 --> 00:36:04,391
No, thank you.

729
00:36:04,391 --> 00:36:05,827
I can go on my own.

730
00:36:07,400 --> 00:36:08,489
You guys have classes in the same building, right?

731
00:36:12,737 --> 00:36:13,332
Get in.

732
00:36:14,887 --> 00:36:18,324
I told you my friends and I can get our own ride.

733
00:36:18,324 --> 00:36:19,296
Let's go, guys.

734
00:36:20,941 --> 00:36:22,003
Hey!

735
00:36:22,365 --> 00:36:23,408
You idiots!

736
00:36:31,869 --> 00:36:32,697
Hurry up.

737
00:36:36,602 --> 00:36:37,267
Damn it!

738
00:36:58,391 --> 00:36:59,245
Thank you.

739
00:36:59,552 --> 00:37:00,139
Thank you.

740
00:37:01,278 --> 00:37:01,940
Uh…

741
00:37:03,211 --> 00:37:05,172
Hey, go and stop them.

742
00:37:05,389 --> 00:37:06,754
If they keep staring at each other like this,
things might escalate.

743
00:37:07,477 --> 00:37:09,390
Hurry. They're about to fight each other.

744
00:37:10,185 --> 00:37:10,834
Go.

745
00:37:10,834 --> 00:37:11,639
Okay.

746
00:37:11,892 --> 00:37:13,011
Uh…

747
00:37:16,229 --> 00:37:17,547
What are you guys doing?

748
00:37:17,638 --> 00:37:18,467
What the hell?

749
00:37:18,467 --> 00:37:18,988
Just do it.

750
00:37:18,988 --> 00:37:19,574
Put your hands together.

751
00:37:19,574 --> 00:37:20,399
Bow down.

752
00:37:20,399 --> 00:37:21,681
Damn it, Po!

753
00:37:21,681 --> 00:37:22,668
Thank you for the ride.

754
00:37:29,331 --> 00:37:29,880
We should go.

755
00:37:29,880 --> 00:37:30,719
Thank you.

756
00:37:37,896 --> 00:37:39,156
Where the hell is Arc?

757
00:37:39,246 --> 00:37:39,892
Hey.

758
00:37:40,417 --> 00:37:40,917
Hey.

759
00:37:41,188 --> 00:37:41,833
Where have you been?

760
00:37:41,833 --> 00:37:42,711
Why are you so late?

761
00:37:47,050 --> 00:37:47,760
I woke up late.

762
00:37:47,941 --> 00:37:48,501
Huh?

763
00:37:50,399 --> 00:37:52,240
You? Woke up late?

764
00:37:54,337 --> 00:37:54,903
Yeah.

765
00:37:55,011 --> 00:37:56,759
So, are you joining tonight?

766
00:37:58,043 --> 00:37:59,357
Warm has booked us a VIP table.

767
00:38:01,707 --> 00:38:02,415
No.

768
00:38:05,731 --> 00:38:06,236
Arc!

769
00:38:07,086 --> 00:38:09,887
Don't tell me you're going with the Perfect 10 Liners!

770
00:38:10,411 --> 00:38:12,772
Yeah. You never cared about those things before.

771
00:38:18,955 --> 00:38:19,933
I just started caring recently.

772
00:38:22,108 --> 00:38:22,643
Damn.

773
00:38:23,283 --> 00:38:24,790
This is not our friend.

774
00:38:25,296 --> 00:38:27,009
He's being possessed.

775
00:38:31,531 --> 00:38:32,059
It's hot, right?

776
00:38:32,059 --> 00:38:32,647
It's cold.

777
00:38:34,129 --> 00:38:35,262
I should've said hot, right?

778
00:38:37,648 --> 00:38:38,152
What's wrong with you guys?

779
00:38:39,038 --> 00:38:39,538
Hey!

780
00:38:41,057 --> 00:38:42,044
You're being weird.

781
00:38:42,641 --> 00:38:44,029
Is there something we don't know?

782
00:38:45,204 --> 00:38:47,778
Arc usually gets really into things for a while.

783
00:38:48,863 --> 00:38:52,348
Lately, he's just been into welcoming his junior

784
00:38:52,800 --> 00:38:53,689
in particular.

785
00:38:54,087 --> 00:38:54,803
Hmm?

786
00:38:55,580 --> 00:38:56,199
Am I right?

787
00:39:00,859 --> 00:39:02,178
Whoa!

788
00:39:02,335 --> 00:39:03,269
This is a lot.

789
00:39:03,603 --> 00:39:05,821
I've never received anything like this in my life.

790
00:39:05,931 --> 00:39:06,725
You're exaggerating.

791
00:39:07,412 --> 00:39:08,771
Are you going to share these snacks with us?

792
00:39:08,771 --> 00:39:09,714
No.

793
00:39:09,930 --> 00:39:11,961
How rude.

794
00:39:11,961 --> 00:39:12,566
Arm.

795
00:39:15,454 --> 00:39:17,591
Damn. That's our faculty's hottest girl.

796
00:39:19,281 --> 00:39:19,781
Yes?

797
00:39:20,292 --> 00:39:21,457
My name is A-ngun.

798
00:39:21,771 --> 00:39:23,344
We met at the campus star contest.

799
00:39:23,855 --> 00:39:25,197
I'm not sure if you remember me.

800
00:39:27,555 --> 00:39:28,446
Of course, I do.

801
00:39:28,446 --> 00:39:30,067
We keep running into each other

802
00:39:30,539 --> 00:39:32,197
but we've never had a chance to talk.

803
00:39:32,393 --> 00:39:33,033
Yeah.

804
00:39:33,937 --> 00:39:36,928
Do you want to talk about something?

805
00:39:37,969 --> 00:39:39,303
Well,

806
00:39:41,012 --> 00:39:42,298
I want to get to know…

807
00:39:42,416 --> 00:39:43,091
Nice to meet you.

808
00:39:43,091 --> 00:39:44,142
I want to get to know Arc,

809
00:39:45,498 --> 00:39:46,805
the senior in your group.

810
00:39:48,613 --> 00:39:52,374
I've asked to follow him on Instagram
and sent him a friend request on Facebook,

811
00:39:52,747 --> 00:39:54,794
but he still hasn't accepted either.

812
00:39:54,794 --> 00:39:57,704
Can you ask him to accept me, Arm?

813
00:39:58,611 --> 00:40:00,258
Please, Arm.

814
00:40:00,258 --> 00:40:01,317
Please help me.

815
00:40:01,317 --> 00:40:02,036
Please.

816
00:40:03,706 --> 00:40:04,942
Okay.

817
00:40:04,942 --> 00:40:06,905
I'll tell Arc.

818
00:40:08,091 --> 00:40:09,464
You're the best.

819
00:40:10,053 --> 00:40:11,504
I have to go.

820
00:40:19,907 --> 00:40:20,569
Damn.

821
00:40:21,316 --> 00:40:22,714
I spent a long time keeping a straight face.

822
00:40:22,714 --> 00:40:24,768
Po, do you have a broom?

823
00:40:24,768 --> 00:40:25,588
Why do you need it?

824
00:40:26,217 --> 00:40:27,662
To sweep up our friend's face.

825
00:40:28,546 --> 00:40:29,046
Shut up.

826
00:40:32,897 --> 00:40:33,702
Hey.

827
00:40:34,131 --> 00:40:35,246
I want this one for myself.

828
00:40:38,783 --> 00:40:39,479
Here you go, buddy.

829
00:40:39,479 --> 00:40:40,059
Wait, Arc.

830
00:40:40,747 --> 00:40:41,389
Where are you going?

831
00:40:42,136 --> 00:40:42,766
What about the second half?

832
00:40:44,181 --> 00:40:44,935
I'm thirsty.

833
00:40:45,112 --> 00:40:46,065
I'm going to get something to drink.

834
00:40:46,517 --> 00:40:47,170
Here.

835
00:40:47,411 --> 00:40:48,587
You can get something super sweet or less sweet.

836
00:40:49,962 --> 00:40:51,110
There's even a protein shake.

837
00:40:54,156 --> 00:40:55,177
I'm hungry too.

838
00:40:57,004 --> 00:40:57,584
I have to go.

839
00:40:57,702 --> 00:40:58,550
I have meatballs here.

840
00:41:01,419 --> 00:41:02,189
Hi.

841
00:41:02,189 --> 00:41:03,610
What drink would you like?

842
00:41:03,610 --> 00:41:04,375
Peach tea, please.

843
00:41:04,375 --> 00:41:05,206
Peach tea, alright.

844
00:41:05,344 --> 00:41:06,508
What about the handsome guy behind you?

845
00:41:06,508 --> 00:41:07,132
Just water, please.

846
00:41:07,132 --> 00:41:08,508
Oh, shit!

847
00:41:15,405 --> 00:41:17,178
Here's your water and peach tea.

848
00:41:20,091 --> 00:41:21,485
This is for the water and peach tea.

849
00:41:22,605 --> 00:41:23,348
Why did you pay for me?

850
00:41:25,392 --> 00:41:26,296
I just wanted to donate to a dog.

851
00:41:29,853 --> 00:41:31,574
Here's your change.

852
00:41:32,418 --> 00:41:33,217
Thank you.

853
00:41:35,339 --> 00:41:37,334
Can't he talk nicely to me once?

854
00:41:39,869 --> 00:41:40,762
Hey, Arc!

855
00:41:40,762 --> 00:41:41,649
That's my drink!

856
00:41:41,649 --> 00:41:42,690
Damn it!

857
00:41:54,101 --> 00:41:54,731
Hey, Arc.

858
00:41:55,831 --> 00:41:57,130
My friend A-ngun wants you

859
00:41:57,740 --> 00:41:59,464
to accept her friend request
on Facebook and Instagram.

860
00:42:04,029 --> 00:42:05,038
Can you hear me?

861
00:42:10,461 --> 00:42:11,467
If you walk away,

862
00:42:12,410 --> 00:42:13,609
I won't accept her friend request.

863
00:42:24,731 --> 00:42:25,903
Why are you alone?

864
00:42:29,656 --> 00:42:30,647
My friends are in the cheering activities.

865
00:42:32,219 --> 00:42:33,712
Then why are you here?

866
00:42:33,908 --> 00:42:34,533
I'm lazy.

867
00:42:36,911 --> 00:42:37,768
If you don't participate in all the activities,

868
00:42:37,768 --> 00:42:39,341
I won't get my pin and gear.

869
00:42:40,245 --> 00:42:41,612
I know that. Don't remind me.

870
00:42:43,105 --> 00:42:47,024
Pun said that if I joined the campus star contest,
I wouldn't have to join the cheering activities.

871
00:42:47,240 --> 00:42:49,286
Who knew I'd end up falling off the stage?

872
00:42:49,777 --> 00:42:52,179
Now it's too late
to log my participation in everything.

873
00:42:52,670 --> 00:42:54,331
So you're just going to loiter around?

874
00:42:57,282 --> 00:42:58,228
I'm a human,

875
00:42:58,719 --> 00:42:59,842
not a ghost.

876
00:43:00,903 --> 00:43:02,697
I'm just eating
while waiting to leave with my friends.

877
00:43:04,584 --> 00:43:05,380
I'll give you a ride.

878
00:43:08,779 --> 00:43:09,651
There's no need.

879
00:43:11,400 --> 00:43:13,944
I can go home by myself.

880
00:43:16,872 --> 00:43:17,703
Hey!

881
00:43:17,959 --> 00:43:18,602
Arc!

882
00:43:19,447 --> 00:43:20,927
That's my last piece of crispy pork.

883
00:43:23,540 --> 00:43:24,607
I haven't even touched it.

884
00:43:40,680 --> 00:43:41,286
Here.

885
00:43:50,206 --> 00:43:51,565
I'll take a shower in your room.

886
00:43:53,314 --> 00:43:54,440
I have some errands nearby,

887
00:43:54,440 --> 00:43:55,523
but I'm too lazy to go back to my condo.

888
00:43:56,091 --> 00:43:58,124
Why didn't you use the shower
at the field after football?

889
00:43:58,320 --> 00:43:59,040
The water wasn't running.

890
00:44:00,573 --> 00:44:03,573
I told you I'm waiting to leave with my friends.

891
00:44:06,795 --> 00:44:07,637
Hey!

892
00:44:15,640 --> 00:44:16,228
Hello?

893
00:44:17,800 --> 00:44:19,879
Tell your friends you're leaving without them.

894
00:44:21,274 --> 00:44:24,101
Why should I do that?

895
00:44:27,127 --> 00:44:27,627
Arm?

896
00:44:29,750 --> 00:44:30,250
Come on.

897
00:44:30,368 --> 00:44:31,745
Hello? Arm?

898
00:44:32,747 --> 00:44:34,860
Hey, I'm leaving now.

899
00:44:35,135 --> 00:44:35,654
What?

900
00:44:39,977 --> 00:44:40,901
What did Arm say?

901
00:44:41,530 --> 00:44:42,611
He said he's leaving without us.

902
00:44:42,611 --> 00:44:44,318
What? I thought he was going to wait for us.

903
00:44:49,800 --> 00:44:50,387
That's it.

904
00:45:06,720 --> 00:45:07,696
You want to take a shower, right?

905
00:45:08,796 --> 00:45:09,497
Make it quick.

906
00:45:18,331 --> 00:45:19,540
Use your own towel.

907
00:45:19,736 --> 00:45:20,423
This one is mine.

908
00:45:22,467 --> 00:45:23,022
Okay.

909
00:45:33,931 --> 00:45:34,639
Ugh!

910
00:45:34,639 --> 00:45:35,986
I'm so freaking pissed!

911
00:45:36,458 --> 00:45:37,134
Damn it!

912
00:45:38,195 --> 00:45:39,678
Why do you keep popping up in my life?

913
00:45:39,973 --> 00:45:42,628
Do you know how much I hate you?

914
00:45:45,595 --> 00:45:46,692
Can I use your shower gel?

915
00:45:49,915 --> 00:45:50,423
Fine.

916
00:45:50,737 --> 00:45:51,287
Just use it.

917
00:45:51,857 --> 00:45:52,962
Speak nicely.

918
00:45:53,119 --> 00:45:54,253
I'm your senior.

919
00:45:57,318 --> 00:45:57,990
Yes, whatever.

920
00:45:58,363 --> 00:45:58,966
Louder.

921
00:46:00,970 --> 00:46:02,177
Yes, whatever.

922
00:46:03,907 --> 00:46:04,955
Damn it!

923
00:46:10,988 --> 00:46:12,392
Go to hell!

924
00:46:12,392 --> 00:46:13,991
You love getting on my nerves, huh?

925
00:46:15,190 --> 00:46:15,966
Damn it!

926
00:46:16,654 --> 00:46:17,506
I'm done.

927
00:46:19,235 --> 00:46:20,100
Hey!

928
00:46:23,951 --> 00:46:24,902
Why haven't you put on a shirt?

929
00:46:27,004 --> 00:46:27,929
Which one is your bed?

930
00:46:28,715 --> 00:46:29,287
That one.

931
00:46:29,851 --> 00:46:30,664
Why do you ask?

932
00:46:34,051 --> 00:46:35,561
Seriously, Arc?

933
00:46:35,974 --> 00:46:36,805
What are you doing?

934
00:46:37,532 --> 00:46:38,808
Go take a shower.

935
00:46:38,808 --> 00:46:39,596
You're in my way.

936
00:46:41,384 --> 00:46:42,506
Get up!

937
00:46:44,091 --> 00:46:45,465
It's my bed!

938
00:46:46,840 --> 00:46:48,989
Why don't you speak politely, Arm?

939
00:46:50,423 --> 00:46:51,301
No!

940
00:46:51,301 --> 00:46:52,951
It's my bed! Get up, Arc!

941
00:46:52,951 --> 00:46:53,830
You're making it dirty!

942
00:47:25,062 --> 00:47:26,497
Why do you love messing with me so much?

943
00:47:26,634 --> 00:47:27,144
Huh?

944
00:47:28,009 --> 00:47:28,951
I just want to welcome my junior.

945
00:47:31,584 --> 00:47:32,366
Sorry.

946
00:47:33,368 --> 00:47:35,424
I'm Pun's peer mentee,

947
00:47:36,072 --> 00:47:37,248
not yours.

948
00:47:37,248 --> 00:47:37,908
Got it?

949
00:47:51,878 --> 00:47:53,491
Apart from you, Arm,

950
00:47:54,729 --> 00:47:56,266
I don't want to mess with anyone else.

951
00:48:21,388 --> 00:48:22,183
It's

952
00:48:23,460 --> 00:48:24,089
not

953
00:48:25,857 --> 00:48:26,551
fun.

954
00:48:38,980 --> 00:48:39,674
Fine!

955
00:48:42,779 --> 00:48:43,912
Sleep here if you want.

956
00:48:44,914 --> 00:48:45,721
Tomorrow,

957
00:48:45,937 --> 00:48:50,300
I'll just wash my bedsheet.

958
00:49:05,497 --> 00:49:07,651
If I didn't know you and Arc hate each other,

959
00:49:07,789 --> 00:49:08,549
Hey!

960
00:49:08,902 --> 00:49:09,875
I'd think

961
00:49:10,386 --> 00:49:11,716
he's hitting on you.

962
00:49:11,716 --> 00:49:14,508
If this is how he's hitting on me,
I'd rather die single.

963
00:49:15,805 --> 00:49:16,704
Where have you been?

964
00:49:17,569 --> 00:49:18,911
That's my business.

965
00:49:18,911 --> 00:49:19,488
Stay out of it.

966
00:49:19,611 --> 00:49:20,771
Hey, Pond.

967
00:49:20,771 --> 00:49:22,126
What are you doing here?

968
00:49:23,521 --> 00:49:25,120
Other people would have
their partner waiting for them,

969
00:49:25,120 --> 00:49:26,709
not dumping it on
their peer mentee's mentee like this.

970
00:49:26,709 --> 00:49:27,699
I'm single.

971
00:49:28,092 --> 00:49:28,931
Then hurry up and find someone.

972
00:49:29,457 --> 00:49:30,291
I am hurrying.
