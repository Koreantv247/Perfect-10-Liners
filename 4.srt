Viewer discretion is advised.

4
00:00:16,944 --> 00:00:18,276
Why did you jump into my car?

5
00:00:18,276 --> 00:00:20,687
You said you wouldn't hurt me again, didn't you?

6
00:00:20,920 --> 00:00:22,135
Why did you take a photo shirtless?

7
00:00:22,135 --> 00:00:23,048
Are you possessive of me?

8
00:00:23,724 --> 00:00:25,850
It's definitely the hidden gem you said it would be.

9
00:00:25,850 --> 00:00:27,301
I'll take you there often.

10
00:00:27,953 --> 00:00:29,797
You only got a pin and you're this flustered.

11
00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:33,528
If you get your gear,
don't have a heart attack.

12
00:00:33,528 --> 00:00:35,652
Your gear is meant for your partner,
not your peer mentee's mentee.

13
00:00:36,739 --> 00:00:37,914
Do you want to be?

14
00:00:38,204 --> 00:00:38,979
What do you mean?

15
00:00:39,245 --> 00:00:40,220
Let's not rush it.

16
00:00:40,848 --> 00:00:42,676
Let me keep flirting with you for a little longer.

17
00:00:42,676 --> 00:00:44,845
♪ If I fall head over heels for you ♪

18
00:00:44,845 --> 00:00:47,515
♪ Then I can point the finger at who? ♪

19
00:00:51,573 --> 00:00:53,146
Let's put money on the line.

20
00:00:53,436 --> 00:00:55,106
Let's see why they called us here.

21
00:00:55,396 --> 00:00:56,241
I bet 2 baht.

22
00:00:56,241 --> 00:00:57,120
This is about the university games.

23
00:00:57,120 --> 00:00:58,390
Wow, you're betting big, huh?

24
00:00:59,260 --> 00:01:00,207
I'll put in 20 baht.

25
00:01:00,593 --> 00:01:03,379
I bet they want us to clean the courtyard.

26
00:01:03,572 --> 00:01:04,866
I heard it from insiders.

27
00:01:04,866 --> 00:01:05,447
Oh.

28
00:01:05,447 --> 00:01:07,001
Get ready to pay.

29
00:01:07,001 --> 00:01:09,421
Everyone, can you keep quiet?

30
00:01:09,421 --> 00:01:13,697
We didn't call you here to clean
the courtyard like the rumor says.

31
00:01:13,697 --> 00:01:14,717
That's fake news.

32
00:01:15,895 --> 00:01:17,684
Insiders, huh?

33
00:01:17,684 --> 00:01:18,583
How's that for insiders?

34
00:01:18,583 --> 00:01:21,021
Damn, they're really humiliating me.

35
00:01:21,021 --> 00:01:28,165
What we want to announce today is
we're hosting Engineers Unite this year.

36
00:01:30,605 --> 00:01:31,452
What's that?

37
00:01:31,452 --> 00:01:32,454
Engineers Unite?

38
00:01:32,599 --> 00:01:33,198
What's that?

39
00:01:33,198 --> 00:01:33,883
I don't know.

40
00:01:33,883 --> 00:01:34,679
I have no idea.

41
00:01:36,000 --> 00:01:39,176
It's an event where engineering students
from other universities will compete with us in football.

42
00:01:39,829 --> 00:01:43,651
There'll also be other activities,
secret buddies across universities,

43
00:01:43,651 --> 00:01:45,437
and games. Something like that.

44
00:01:45,823 --> 00:01:47,323
Hi, Pond.

45
00:01:47,323 --> 00:01:48,469
- Hi.
- Hi.

46
00:01:48,469 --> 00:01:49,388
Why are you here?

47
00:01:49,388 --> 00:01:50,153
To take care of…

48
00:01:54,500 --> 00:01:55,569
To take care of you juniors.

49
00:01:55,569 --> 00:01:57,069
Oh, he's here to take care of us juniors.

50
00:01:57,069 --> 00:01:57,569
Oh.

51
00:01:57,569 --> 00:01:59,447
He's here to take care of us juniors.

52
00:01:59,592 --> 00:02:01,478
But why are you here alone?

53
00:02:01,478 --> 00:02:02,747
Where are your friends?

54
00:02:03,206 --> 00:02:06,439
Warm and Copp are practicing football for this event.

55
00:02:07,019 --> 00:02:07,979
As for Arc,

56
00:02:09,428 --> 00:02:10,758
he doesn't care about these things.

57
00:02:11,000 --> 00:02:12,344
He doesn't even take care of himself,

58
00:02:12,344 --> 00:02:13,910
let alone anyone else.

59
00:02:18,000 --> 00:02:19,056
It's my pin.

60
00:02:19,370 --> 00:02:20,021
Huh?

61
00:02:31,011 --> 00:02:32,724
Now that you know, don't lose it.

62
00:02:44,000 --> 00:02:44,545
Oh,

63
00:02:44,747 --> 00:02:45,429
Arc is here.

64
00:02:45,520 --> 00:02:46,730
I thought you said he wouldn't come.

65
00:02:48,759 --> 00:02:49,612
Oh, I forgot.

66
00:02:49,612 --> 00:02:51,143
There's an exception now.

67
00:02:52,013 --> 00:02:53,054
Have you come to welcome your junior again?

68
00:02:53,280 --> 00:02:53,853
No.

69
00:02:54,239 --> 00:02:55,069
Then why are you here?

70
00:02:56,397 --> 00:02:57,000
Arm!

71
00:02:57,000 --> 00:02:57,500
Huh?

72
00:02:58,103 --> 00:02:59,211
Why didn't you pick up my calls?

73
00:03:00,000 --> 00:03:00,707
Me?

74
00:03:01,093 --> 00:03:01,718
Yes.

75
00:03:06,000 --> 00:03:06,863
Oh.

76
00:03:07,950 --> 00:03:08,818
I forgot to turn on the sound.

77
00:03:08,818 --> 00:03:09,568
I didn't hear it ring.

78
00:03:09,568 --> 00:03:10,290
What did you say?

79
00:03:11,498 --> 00:03:12,896
I said I forgot to turn on the sound.

80
00:03:12,896 --> 00:03:13,607
I didn't hear it ring.

81
00:03:14,259 --> 00:03:15,236
What did you want to talk about?

82
00:03:15,236 --> 00:03:16,913
Meet me at the field after this meeting.

83
00:03:17,541 --> 00:03:18,392
Why?

84
00:03:18,392 --> 00:03:19,297
I have practice.

85
00:03:19,297 --> 00:03:20,444
Fine, I'll be there.

86
00:03:21,700 --> 00:03:22,431
See you later.

87
00:03:22,431 --> 00:03:23,119
Yeah.

88
00:03:23,119 --> 00:03:23,743
I'll catch up with you.

89
00:03:27,680 --> 00:03:28,921
You're done flirting, right?

90
00:03:30,105 --> 00:03:31,566
Please continue, Pun.

91
00:05:07,651 --> 00:05:08,151
Hurry!

92
00:05:08,151 --> 00:05:08,841
We don't want to be late for the first half!

93
00:05:08,841 --> 00:05:09,902
What's going on with you, Sand?

94
00:05:09,902 --> 00:05:10,419
We don't want to be late for the first half!

95
00:05:10,419 --> 00:05:11,576
Stop it, Sand!

96
00:05:11,842 --> 00:05:12,387
Damn it!

97
00:05:12,387 --> 00:05:12,994
Sand!

98
00:05:14,515 --> 00:05:15,827
We don't want to be late for the first half.

99
00:05:15,827 --> 00:05:16,953
Stop it!

100
00:05:17,581 --> 00:05:20,051
What's the hurry?

101
00:05:20,196 --> 00:05:21,475
It's just practice.

102
00:05:21,475 --> 00:05:22,717
What's going with you, Sand?

103
00:05:24,166 --> 00:05:25,088
Nothing.

104
00:05:25,354 --> 00:05:27,191
I…I…

105
00:05:27,481 --> 00:05:28,818
I don't want Arc to make a scene.

106
00:05:30,799 --> 00:05:31,871
Why would he?

107
00:05:33,972 --> 00:05:34,648
Oh, right.

108
00:05:34,841 --> 00:05:36,783
We don't want your sweetheart

109
00:05:36,783 --> 00:05:37,914
to miss you.

110
00:05:37,914 --> 00:05:38,995
Yeah, he'll miss you.

111
00:05:38,995 --> 00:05:39,872
We should hurry there.

112
00:05:39,872 --> 00:05:40,988
He's waiting.

113
00:05:41,133 --> 00:05:41,724
Alright, then.

114
00:05:41,840 --> 00:05:42,545
Let's go.

115
00:05:42,545 --> 00:05:43,456
Run!

116
00:05:43,640 --> 00:05:44,541
Hey, hold on!

117
00:05:49,127 --> 00:05:49,938
Hey!

118
00:05:51,170 --> 00:05:52,961
Whoa!

119
00:05:53,830 --> 00:05:54,613
They're so good!

120
00:05:54,999 --> 00:05:55,732
So cool!

121
00:05:55,732 --> 00:05:56,524
Well-played!

122
00:05:58,650 --> 00:05:59,263
Amazing.

123
00:06:00,181 --> 00:06:01,027
Hey, kids.

124
00:06:01,027 --> 00:06:02,499
- Hi.
- Hi.

125
00:06:02,499 --> 00:06:04,944
Wow, with overflowing support like this,

126
00:06:05,186 --> 00:06:06,433
my team is definitely going to win.

127
00:06:06,892 --> 00:06:08,101
You mean from me?

128
00:06:10,203 --> 00:06:10,785
What are you talking about?

129
00:06:10,785 --> 00:06:11,630
What are you doing?

130
00:06:12,475 --> 00:06:13,325
Let's keep watching them.

131
00:06:13,808 --> 00:06:14,937
Come on!

132
00:06:17,159 --> 00:06:18,412
Oh, shit!

133
00:06:18,511 --> 00:06:19,150
Arc.

134
00:06:19,150 --> 00:06:19,846
Arc!

135
00:06:20,063 --> 00:06:21,152
Stop!

136
00:06:22,215 --> 00:06:22,803
Arc!

137
00:06:23,890 --> 00:06:24,688
Damn.

138
00:06:27,803 --> 00:06:28,906
One, two, three.

139
00:06:31,176 --> 00:06:31,993
Slowly.

140
00:06:35,616 --> 00:06:37,358
Can you please make some room?

141
00:06:39,339 --> 00:06:40,584
One, two, three.

142
00:06:43,652 --> 00:06:44,410
Damn.

143
00:06:44,700 --> 00:06:45,455
Guys.

144
00:06:45,841 --> 00:06:47,173
He's bleeding.

145
00:06:47,387 --> 00:06:48,062
I can't.

146
00:06:48,062 --> 00:06:48,894
Hey.

147
00:06:48,894 --> 00:06:49,880
Don't look.

148
00:06:52,320 --> 00:06:53,059
It's okay.

149
00:06:53,059 --> 00:06:54,168
I have someone to help.

150
00:06:54,868 --> 00:06:57,045
Okay, then I'll leave the equipment here.

151
00:06:57,166 --> 00:06:57,790
Alright.

152
00:07:01,606 --> 00:07:04,247
Arm, dress my wound.

153
00:07:05,793 --> 00:07:06,527
Me?

154
00:07:06,938 --> 00:07:07,976
Yes, you.

155
00:07:09,570 --> 00:07:10,784
I'm not good at dressing wounds.

156
00:07:10,784 --> 00:07:11,430
I know.

157
00:07:11,430 --> 00:07:12,634
You're in engineering, not med school.

158
00:07:12,779 --> 00:07:13,860
Just do it. Come on.

159
00:07:14,585 --> 00:07:15,308
Oh.

160
00:07:16,491 --> 00:07:17,481
Damn it.

161
00:07:19,220 --> 00:07:21,068
Why didn't you let the experts do this?

162
00:07:21,285 --> 00:07:22,432
Why did you send them away?

163
00:07:23,471 --> 00:07:24,821
Don't ask. Just do it.

164
00:07:24,821 --> 00:07:25,813
It hurts so bad.

165
00:07:29,509 --> 00:07:30,656
Let me clean the wound first.

166
00:07:32,782 --> 00:07:35,400
Let's go back to playing.

167
00:07:35,400 --> 00:07:36,135
Yeah.

168
00:07:37,029 --> 00:07:37,810
Do your best.

169
00:07:37,810 --> 00:07:38,574
I'm rooting for you guys.

170
00:07:38,574 --> 00:07:39,074
Hey.

171
00:07:39,074 --> 00:07:40,172
We're missing one player.

172
00:07:40,341 --> 00:07:41,244
Yeah, Copp.

173
00:07:41,413 --> 00:07:43,084
I think he has potential.

174
00:07:43,326 --> 00:07:45,788
Everyone says that
but I play basketball.

175
00:07:45,788 --> 00:07:46,847
Hey, but you seem to have potential.

176
00:07:46,847 --> 00:07:47,462
Come on.

177
00:07:47,462 --> 00:07:48,327
Let's play football, bro.

178
00:07:48,810 --> 00:07:49,331
Hey.

179
00:07:49,983 --> 00:07:50,748
I'm not your bro.

180
00:07:50,748 --> 00:07:51,619
Come on.

181
00:07:51,619 --> 00:07:52,490
Hey.
What are you doing?

182
00:07:52,490 --> 00:07:52,990
No.

183
00:07:52,990 --> 00:07:53,574
Come with us.

184
00:07:53,574 --> 00:07:54,951
- It's okay. We'll help you.
- Hey!

185
00:07:55,386 --> 00:07:56,830
Can you still move your knee?

186
00:07:57,458 --> 00:07:58,105
No.

187
00:07:59,313 --> 00:08:00,187
Does it sting?

188
00:08:03,375 --> 00:08:04,152
Be gentle.

189
00:08:04,152 --> 00:08:05,387
I know.

190
00:08:06,546 --> 00:08:07,518
What to do next?

191
00:08:08,653 --> 00:08:11,859
Don't put your weight on your left foot.

192
00:08:12,946 --> 00:08:14,554
Do you know nothing?

193
00:08:22,887 --> 00:08:24,181
Go wash yourself

194
00:08:24,567 --> 00:08:25,758
so we can hurry up and dress your wound.

195
00:08:31,168 --> 00:08:31,853
Here.

196
00:08:32,626 --> 00:08:33,491
Now, grab the towel for me.

197
00:08:34,916 --> 00:08:35,501
‘ 	Alright.

198
00:08:37,119 --> 00:08:37,751
Here you go.

199
00:08:39,538 --> 00:08:40,768
Don't let your wound get wet.

200
00:08:41,589 --> 00:08:42,711
I know.

201
00:08:48,000 --> 00:08:51,382
Ugh, this freaking stinks.

202
00:08:51,503 --> 00:08:52,601
It smells so sour.

203
00:08:53,760 --> 00:08:54,549
Arc!

204
00:08:54,549 --> 00:08:55,238
What?

205
00:08:55,649 --> 00:08:56,983
Do you have another shirt to change into?

206
00:08:56,983 --> 00:08:58,995
This one freaking stinks.

207
00:08:59,454 --> 00:09:00,862
It's in locker number 14.

208
00:09:00,862 --> 00:09:01,854
Go ahead and grab it.

209
00:09:02,240 --> 00:09:03,038
Okay.

210
00:09:07,772 --> 00:09:08,555
Ugh.

211
00:09:09,811 --> 00:09:11,477
Does he ever wash his clothes?

212
00:09:18,400 --> 00:09:19,289
Hey!

213
00:09:19,989 --> 00:09:22,003
I told you to wash yourself,
not get a spa treatment.

214
00:09:22,003 --> 00:09:23,254
You're taking so long.

215
00:09:28,230 --> 00:09:29,519
Here, I only found this one.

216
00:09:30,823 --> 00:09:31,483
Okay.

217
00:09:34,647 --> 00:09:35,912
Go change properly

218
00:09:36,226 --> 00:09:37,518
so we can hurry up and dress your wound

219
00:09:37,518 --> 00:09:38,865
before you get infected and die.

220
00:09:39,131 --> 00:09:41,740
I'm not dying anytime soon.

221
00:09:42,948 --> 00:09:43,899
Why not?

222
00:09:44,648 --> 00:09:46,777
Are you scared of going to hell?

223
00:09:53,516 --> 00:09:54,246
Hey.

224
00:09:55,695 --> 00:09:57,347
I don't want you to die single,

225
00:09:59,787 --> 00:10:00,551
Nong Arm.

226
00:10:29,165 --> 00:10:29,798
Ouch!

227
00:10:30,209 --> 00:10:31,051
Stop overreacting.

228
00:10:35,519 --> 00:10:36,660
You can drive, right?

229
00:10:36,998 --> 00:10:38,462
Drive me to my condo.

230
00:10:40,539 --> 00:10:42,000
I spent so long dressing your wound

231
00:10:42,556 --> 00:10:44,014
and not even a thank you.

232
00:10:44,014 --> 00:10:44,700
Damn it!

233
00:10:45,038 --> 00:10:46,095
Thanks.

234
00:10:47,472 --> 00:10:48,751
Leave it there.

235
00:10:49,331 --> 00:10:50,167
Where?

236
00:10:53,186 --> 00:10:54,220
In your heart?

237
00:10:54,727 --> 00:10:56,401
But I guess that's not possible.

238
00:10:56,908 --> 00:10:58,080
Your heart is probably cluttered.

239
00:10:58,080 --> 00:10:58,742
Yes.

240
00:10:59,612 --> 00:11:01,515
It's cluttered and cramped.

241
00:11:01,974 --> 00:11:03,192
Don't accidentally get in there.

242
00:11:04,520 --> 00:11:05,654
I'm not claustrophobic.

243
00:11:07,949 --> 00:11:08,927
Drive me.

244
00:11:18,595 --> 00:11:19,390
Have you stopped being scared?

245
00:11:21,177 --> 00:11:24,419
I'm actually not that scared.

246
00:11:24,760 --> 00:11:25,673
Oh?

247
00:11:26,011 --> 00:11:28,218
You looked pale, so I brought you away.

248
00:11:29,571 --> 00:11:31,729
Shall we go back to the field?

249
00:11:31,729 --> 00:11:33,130
Our friends must be waiting.

250
00:11:33,516 --> 00:11:34,180
Oh.

251
00:11:34,711 --> 00:11:36,731
Arm is driving Arc to his place,

252
00:11:36,731 --> 00:11:39,500
Pipo is having fun playing football with Warm,

253
00:11:42,326 --> 00:11:44,441
and I've already told your friends

254
00:11:44,441 --> 00:11:46,075
I'll give you a ride to your dorm.

255
00:11:49,239 --> 00:11:52,775
But I'm so hungry.

256
00:11:52,775 --> 00:11:54,488
Oh!

257
00:11:56,952 --> 00:11:59,475
Um, I…

258
00:11:59,475 --> 00:12:01,972
Oh, I'm so hungry.

259
00:12:14,894 --> 00:12:15,842
I'm hungry too.

260
00:12:18,112 --> 00:12:18,880
Po!

261
00:12:18,880 --> 00:12:19,482
Come on!

262
00:12:20,496 --> 00:12:21,839
Go! Run!

263
00:12:24,641 --> 00:12:26,001
Keep going.

264
00:12:27,547 --> 00:12:28,241
Yes!

265
00:12:28,241 --> 00:12:29,140
Let's go.

266
00:12:31,918 --> 00:12:32,731
Come on!

267
00:12:32,731 --> 00:12:33,664
Grab it!

268
00:12:33,905 --> 00:12:34,553
Dribble it!

269
00:12:34,553 --> 00:12:35,750
Not like that!

270
00:12:40,640 --> 00:12:41,350
Get up!

271
00:12:42,040 --> 00:12:43,154
Kick it to the goal!

272
00:12:44,676 --> 00:12:46,041
Yes!

273
00:12:50,630 --> 00:12:52,638
Whoa, you ordered all this?

274
00:12:53,459 --> 00:12:54,739
It's late, so I figured

275
00:12:54,739 --> 00:12:56,081
I should order the food in advance.

276
00:12:56,709 --> 00:12:58,369
Not sure if you'll like it though.

277
00:12:59,440 --> 00:13:00,982
You read my mind.

278
00:13:01,682 --> 00:13:03,742
How do you know what I want to eat?

279
00:13:04,160 --> 00:13:06,571
I won't hold back then.

280
00:13:06,800 --> 00:13:07,506
Go ahead.

281
00:13:13,424 --> 00:13:14,175
Mm.

282
00:13:14,803 --> 00:13:15,467
Yummy.

283
00:13:17,254 --> 00:13:18,264
You're so good at this.

284
00:13:20,390 --> 00:13:21,225
I'm good?

285
00:13:24,413 --> 00:13:25,508
Is something wrong?

286
00:13:28,213 --> 00:13:29,892
Not many people say I'm good at anything.

287
00:13:32,090 --> 00:13:36,274
Since childhood, I've not been good at anything.

288
00:13:37,216 --> 00:13:39,282
I can play many sports

289
00:13:39,765 --> 00:13:41,088
but I can't excel in any.

290
00:13:42,489 --> 00:13:44,941
I play music, but I don't know what kind I like.

291
00:13:45,762 --> 00:13:48,967
I'm studying engineering just because I got in.

292
00:13:53,291 --> 00:13:56,836
I don't know how to do any of the things you said.

293
00:13:58,116 --> 00:13:59,094
To me,

294
00:14:00,108 --> 00:14:01,240
you're so talented, Pond.

295
00:14:01,240 --> 00:14:02,197
Really?

296
00:14:03,525 --> 00:14:04,219
Of course.

297
00:14:04,822 --> 00:14:06,410
You're my talented person.

298
00:14:08,439 --> 00:14:09,785
Your talented person, Sand?

299
00:14:15,679 --> 00:14:16,509
Just eat.

300
00:14:17,475 --> 00:14:19,162
Okay, talented person.

301
00:14:20,313 --> 00:14:21,388
Don't make me poke you.

302
00:14:32,088 --> 00:14:33,035
Do you want anything else?

303
00:14:33,035 --> 00:14:33,844
I'm heading out.

304
00:14:34,423 --> 00:14:35,018
No,

305
00:14:35,404 --> 00:14:38,387
but aren't you staying to eat with me?

306
00:14:39,087 --> 00:14:40,600
I didn't think you'd ask.

307
00:14:42,412 --> 00:14:43,193
I'm ready.

308
00:14:43,676 --> 00:14:44,745
Yes.

309
00:14:44,745 --> 00:14:46,375
These are all my favorites.

310
00:14:50,819 --> 00:14:52,360
Go ahead. Don't hold back.

311
00:15:03,206 --> 00:15:04,236
I'm so full.

312
00:15:06,651 --> 00:15:08,032
Go take a shower and sleep.

313
00:15:08,032 --> 00:15:09,900
Let me clean up.

314
00:15:10,311 --> 00:15:11,655
You can leave it here.

315
00:15:11,655 --> 00:15:12,463
The maid is coming tomorrow.

316
00:15:12,826 --> 00:15:15,783
Come on. We don't need to bother her.

317
00:15:16,363 --> 00:15:17,666
Go take a shower.

318
00:15:18,825 --> 00:15:21,273
Oh, don't let your wound get wet.

319
00:15:24,534 --> 00:15:25,362
Got it?

320
00:15:28,671 --> 00:15:29,472
Hey.

321
00:15:30,200 --> 00:15:31,428
Why are you zoning out?

322
00:15:31,670 --> 00:15:32,968
Go take a shower.

323
00:15:45,172 --> 00:15:46,923
Thanks for the meal

324
00:15:47,116 --> 00:15:49,672
but next time let me treat you for a change.

325
00:15:49,672 --> 00:15:50,493
Sure.

326
00:15:50,614 --> 00:15:51,909
I'll pick out somewhere fancy in advance.

327
00:15:53,068 --> 00:15:54,357
That's so mean.

328
00:15:55,227 --> 00:15:56,242
Just kidding.

329
00:15:56,508 --> 00:15:58,123
It's time to head up to your room.

330
00:15:58,509 --> 00:15:59,356
I'm going then.

331
00:16:01,868 --> 00:16:02,648
Good night.

332
00:16:03,720 --> 00:16:04,651
Good night.

333
00:16:34,358 --> 00:16:35,181
Hey!

334
00:16:35,616 --> 00:16:36,767
I'm still here.

335
00:16:37,540 --> 00:16:39,148
Were you looking for me?

336
00:16:41,080 --> 00:16:42,281
I wasn't looking for you.

337
00:16:44,020 --> 00:16:44,886
Oh, really?

338
00:16:46,673 --> 00:16:47,953
You just don't want to admit it.

339
00:16:50,223 --> 00:16:51,360
I was just going to turn off the lights.

340
00:16:51,553 --> 00:16:52,681
I left many on.

341
00:16:54,420 --> 00:16:56,357
Oh.

342
00:16:56,357 --> 00:16:57,454
I see.

343
00:16:58,146 --> 00:16:59,074
I'm really leaving now.

344
00:16:59,074 --> 00:16:59,912
Bye.

345
00:17:00,951 --> 00:17:01,707
Wait.

346
00:17:06,000 --> 00:17:06,646
Hmm?

347
00:17:15,510 --> 00:17:16,459
Thank you.

348
00:17:17,812 --> 00:17:18,945
Text me when you get to your room.

349
00:17:19,476 --> 00:17:20,248
Okay?

350
00:17:22,035 --> 00:17:22,728
I will

351
00:17:23,284 --> 00:17:24,755
if you don't block me.

352
00:17:25,407 --> 00:17:26,178
I won't.

353
00:17:28,038 --> 00:17:29,064
That better be true.

354
00:17:31,479 --> 00:17:33,133
I won't block someone I'm getting to know.

355
00:17:39,341 --> 00:17:41,814
Yeah, well, I'm leaving.

356
00:17:42,200 --> 00:17:42,890
Bye.

357
00:17:56,839 --> 00:18:00,564
IF YOU GET A FEVER, TAKE THE MEDICINE.
BUT IF YOU MISS ME, DRINK THIS.

358
00:18:03,994 --> 00:18:05,086
DUTCH MILL 4 IN 1

359
00:18:25,484 --> 00:18:26,580
Hey, you're back.

360
00:18:26,675 --> 00:18:27,275
Yeah.

361
00:18:28,274 --> 00:18:29,169
How's Arc?

362
00:18:30,564 --> 00:18:31,208
He has a wound.

363
00:18:31,585 --> 00:18:33,020
Don't get on my nerves.

364
00:18:36,338 --> 00:18:36,950
By the way, Sand,

365
00:18:38,458 --> 00:18:43,727
I think Arc is acting weird.

366
00:18:45,480 --> 00:18:46,069
How?

367
00:18:46,729 --> 00:18:47,699
It seems like he…

368
00:18:56,843 --> 00:18:58,236
Shit!

369
00:18:59,311 --> 00:19:00,300
Sand!

370
00:19:00,300 --> 00:19:01,503
Help me.

371
00:19:04,520 --> 00:19:06,319
Help.

372
00:19:09,863 --> 00:19:11,487
Po!

373
00:19:12,203 --> 00:19:14,339
Who did this to you?

374
00:19:17,287 --> 00:19:18,359
How are you feeling?

375
00:19:19,000 --> 00:19:20,075
Do you want to go to the hospital?

376
00:19:21,206 --> 00:19:22,892
Don't act like you care about me now.

377
00:19:23,024 --> 00:19:25,829
When you guys left me,
neither of you gave a damn.

378
00:19:26,225 --> 00:19:29,250
No, Pond told me you were enjoying football,

379
00:19:29,250 --> 00:19:31,208
so I didn't want to interrupt.

380
00:19:31,208 --> 00:19:31,758
Yeah.

381
00:19:31,758 --> 00:19:32,527
You think I was enjoying that?

382
00:19:32,527 --> 00:19:33,482
I had fun?

383
00:19:33,482 --> 00:19:34,402
Yeah, right!

384
00:19:35,167 --> 00:19:36,818
We've studied together since kindergarten.

385
00:19:37,044 --> 00:19:38,922
Have you ever seen me play football?

386
00:19:42,429 --> 00:19:43,111
What about you?

387
00:19:44,336 --> 00:19:45,454
Do you have any excuses?

388
00:19:46,038 --> 00:19:47,149
Come on, Po.

389
00:19:47,149 --> 00:19:49,580
You saw that Arc hurt his knee.

390
00:19:50,278 --> 00:19:51,438
How could I have left him?

391
00:19:51,967 --> 00:19:54,381
At the end of the day, it's all the same reason.

392
00:19:58,454 --> 00:19:59,448
What reason?

393
00:20:02,287 --> 00:20:04,163
You both are getting a partner!

394
00:20:04,615 --> 00:20:05,254
Okay?

395
00:20:06,989 --> 00:20:11,011
I don't think that's the case for me.

396
00:20:16,516 --> 00:20:17,354
I don't think so.

397
00:20:17,599 --> 00:20:19,968
But you said yourself that Arc is acting weird.

398
00:20:20,345 --> 00:20:23,180
Yes, he is, but it doesn't mean he likes me.

399
00:20:24,047 --> 00:20:25,276
We must find a way to prove it.

400
00:20:26,935 --> 00:20:27,477
Really?

401
00:20:29,664 --> 00:20:30,345
What do we do?

402
00:20:30,647 --> 00:20:31,874
What do we do, Po?

403
00:20:32,287 --> 00:20:33,482
What? Hey!

404
00:20:33,784 --> 00:20:35,783
Ouch!

405
00:20:36,236 --> 00:20:37,043
Why are we crouching?

406
00:20:38,155 --> 00:20:38,757
What?

407
00:20:39,398 --> 00:20:40,512
Hey, Arm!

408
00:20:42,152 --> 00:20:43,231
What are you doing there?

409
00:20:46,606 --> 00:20:47,287
Oh.

410
00:20:49,097 --> 00:20:49,850
You saw me.

411
00:20:51,603 --> 00:20:52,660
I'm glad I ran into you.

412
00:20:53,376 --> 00:20:54,467
Can we talk?

413
00:21:00,349 --> 00:21:01,484
It's about Arc.

414
00:21:02,287 --> 00:21:03,580
I'm sorry, A-ngun.

415
00:21:03,580 --> 00:21:05,496
He hasn't accepted your friend request, right?

416
00:21:05,496 --> 00:21:08,447
I tried my best, but he won't accept anyone.

417
00:21:08,541 --> 00:21:09,691
I'm sorry.

418
00:21:10,427 --> 00:21:13,194
Arm, I'm not mad at you about that.

419
00:21:14,438 --> 00:21:14,955
Oh?

420
00:21:16,350 --> 00:21:21,083
If not that, what are you mad at me about?

421
00:21:23,817 --> 00:21:27,717
Well,
you wouldn't tell me Arc likes you.

422
00:21:28,151 --> 00:21:29,175
That's crazy, A-ngun.

423
00:21:30,457 --> 00:21:31,762
That's impossible.

424
00:21:32,629 --> 00:21:34,086
How can Arc like me?

425
00:21:34,181 --> 00:21:36,835
Besides, Arc is so handsome and cool.

426
00:21:36,835 --> 00:21:38,129
He might already be dating someone

427
00:21:38,563 --> 00:21:39,736
but just doesn't want to tell people

428
00:21:40,019 --> 00:21:41,339
because he's scared of losing popularity.

429
00:21:41,999 --> 00:21:43,004
Hmm.

430
00:21:43,645 --> 00:21:46,191
But I've never seen him close with anyone

431
00:21:46,530 --> 00:21:48,013
like he's with you, Arm.

432
00:21:48,918 --> 00:21:51,651
That's because I'm in his peer mentoring group.

433
00:21:53,065 --> 00:21:54,652
You don't have to believe me

434
00:21:55,029 --> 00:21:57,645
but it doesn't hurt to prove it.

435
00:22:03,735 --> 00:22:09,668
Every member of the Perfect 10 Liners
has a pair of symbolic magnetic bracelets.

436
00:22:09,913 --> 00:22:10,736
Can I have some?

437
00:22:10,736 --> 00:22:11,680
Yes, this is too much.

438
00:22:12,547 --> 00:22:13,878
They can give one to the person they like.

439
00:22:21,329 --> 00:22:23,665
If Arc still has both bracelets,

440
00:22:24,155 --> 00:22:25,900
it means he's not taken.

441
00:22:28,690 --> 00:22:29,381
Arm.

442
00:22:30,738 --> 00:22:31,522
Is something wrong?

443
00:22:31,647 --> 00:22:32,287
Oh, nothing.

444
00:22:33,626 --> 00:22:34,648
Nice bracelet.

445
00:22:36,816 --> 00:22:37,554
This one?

446
00:22:40,118 --> 00:22:40,892
Shit!

447
00:22:42,023 --> 00:22:42,672
Oh, no!

448
00:22:42,672 --> 00:22:44,537
What's wrong, Pun?

449
00:22:44,537 --> 00:22:46,903
I forgot to take Arm to get his group bracelet.

450
00:22:47,563 --> 00:22:48,275
Oh.

451
00:22:52,008 --> 00:22:53,019
Group bracelet?

452
00:22:53,471 --> 00:22:57,501
It's a tradition that's been passed down in our group.

453
00:22:57,727 --> 00:23:03,568
As a senior, I need to get you one
to show that you're fully part of the group.

454
00:23:04,774 --> 00:23:05,457
I forgot.

455
00:23:07,041 --> 00:23:08,224
Is it that serious?

456
00:23:09,242 --> 00:23:09,751
Yeah.

457
00:23:09,751 --> 00:23:10,541
Stop exaggerating, Pun.

458
00:23:11,766 --> 00:23:12,554
Come on.

459
00:23:13,252 --> 00:23:15,628
By the way, where's Tawan?

460
00:23:16,156 --> 00:23:17,106
Is he out of the forest?

461
00:23:18,275 --> 00:23:21,874
I heard he opened a place by the sea near Rayong.

462
00:23:22,081 --> 00:23:25,682
Once I'm free, I'll take you there
so you can get yours.

463
00:23:28,076 --> 00:23:30,869
Can't we order it online?

464
00:23:33,396 --> 00:23:35,559
No, it won't be sacred.

465
00:23:36,539 --> 00:23:37,328
Oh.

466
00:24:00,086 --> 00:24:01,033
What are you daydreaming about?

467
00:24:02,287 --> 00:24:03,456
Are you done practicing?

468
00:24:03,814 --> 00:24:04,853
I have somewhere to be after this.

469
00:24:07,287 --> 00:24:08,159
Where are you hurrying off to?

470
00:24:08,800 --> 00:24:09,634
The Bang On bar.

471
00:24:10,030 --> 00:24:11,157
I'm meeting my classmates there.

472
00:24:14,852 --> 00:24:15,421
Come on.

473
00:24:17,476 --> 00:24:19,128
It's just practice
and you're already out of breath.

474
00:24:20,052 --> 00:24:21,603
I guess there's no way you're going to win.

475
00:24:22,753 --> 00:24:24,354
I should practice how to lose face.

476
00:24:24,920 --> 00:24:26,010
What pose should I strike?

477
00:24:26,463 --> 00:24:27,494
Oh, we lost.

478
00:24:27,494 --> 00:24:27,994
Oh.

479
00:24:28,673 --> 00:24:29,680
What if I win?

480
00:24:29,680 --> 00:24:30,573
What will you give me?

481
00:24:32,025 --> 00:24:34,759
If you win, you can have anything.

482
00:24:34,759 --> 00:24:35,538
Ask away.

483
00:24:35,670 --> 00:24:36,896
Just make sure you win.

484
00:24:38,178 --> 00:24:38,845
Okay.

485
00:24:39,090 --> 00:24:41,616
Once I know what I want, I'll tell you.

486
00:24:50,572 --> 00:24:52,451
Hey, are you leaving already?

487
00:24:52,734 --> 00:24:55,364
No, I'm going to buy you some tissues.

488
00:24:55,816 --> 00:24:56,557
No need.

489
00:24:57,009 --> 00:24:58,061
I have a towel in my bag.

490
00:25:12,707 --> 00:25:15,268
If Arc still has both bracelets,

491
00:25:16,493 --> 00:25:18,485
it means he's not taken.

492
00:25:19,635 --> 00:25:22,599
But even if he has both bracelets,

493
00:25:23,127 --> 00:25:25,247
it doesn't mean he likes me.

494
00:25:26,397 --> 00:25:28,264
Once you've proved it,

495
00:25:28,924 --> 00:25:30,437
you test it.

496
00:25:32,492 --> 00:25:34,195
Arm, can I get my towel now?

497
00:25:34,534 --> 00:25:35,548
Yes.

498
00:25:38,282 --> 00:25:38,855
Here.

499
00:25:41,947 --> 00:25:43,451
Even though my bag is cluttered,

500
00:25:47,071 --> 00:25:48,304
my heart is not.

501
00:25:48,756 --> 00:25:49,317
Who said that?

502
00:25:50,599 --> 00:25:51,241
See for yourself.

503
00:25:55,106 --> 00:25:55,994
What's he talking about?

504
00:26:09,277 --> 00:26:10,233
Over here, Arc.

505
00:26:15,493 --> 00:26:16,387
By the way,

506
00:26:16,990 --> 00:26:17,872
can I ask you something?

507
00:26:18,230 --> 00:26:18,829
What is it?

508
00:26:19,413 --> 00:26:21,454
Who's Tawan?

509
00:26:22,057 --> 00:26:22,963
Why do you ask?

510
00:26:24,641 --> 00:26:27,736
Pun made him sound so mysterious.

511
00:26:28,207 --> 00:26:29,260
It's actually nothing.

512
00:26:29,486 --> 00:26:31,440
He's just the first member of Perfect 10 Liners.

513
00:26:33,457 --> 00:26:35,290
So, why do we get our bracelets made with him?

514
00:26:35,457 --> 00:26:36,671
Does he move around a lot?

515
00:26:37,086 --> 00:26:38,928
Tawan is actually independent.

516
00:26:39,154 --> 00:26:41,169
After graduation, he's been traveling

517
00:26:41,395 --> 00:26:44,083
and opened a shop selling photos
and handmade items.

518
00:26:44,385 --> 00:26:49,311
The bracelet thing was his idea
to help seniors and juniors bond quickly.

519
00:26:49,971 --> 00:26:51,175
Ah.

520
00:26:51,948 --> 00:26:54,982
So when Pun takes me to get my bracelet,

521
00:26:55,227 --> 00:26:57,333
it's like going on vacation, right?

522
00:26:58,445 --> 00:26:59,138
That's right.

523
00:27:00,382 --> 00:27:02,256
You're such a clever puppy.

524
00:27:02,256 --> 00:27:03,551
What brand of dog food do you eat?

525
00:27:03,551 --> 00:27:04,217
Hey!

526
00:27:05,216 --> 00:27:06,338
I'm not a dog.

527
00:27:07,431 --> 00:27:08,089
Arm!

528
00:27:12,067 --> 00:27:13,163
I'm coming!

529
00:27:14,822 --> 00:27:15,555
I'm leaving then.

530
00:27:15,857 --> 00:27:16,357
Bye.

531
00:27:16,357 --> 00:27:16,901
Okay.

532
00:27:17,881 --> 00:27:18,597
Just a moment!

533
00:27:32,139 --> 00:27:34,878
Pun, can I have Tawan's shop address?

534
00:27:39,952 --> 00:27:43,785
This song is for those who've been hurt
over and over again.

535
00:27:43,936 --> 00:27:45,795
Sing along if you can!

536
00:27:45,795 --> 00:27:46,513
Ah.

537
00:27:47,287 --> 00:27:48,949
Yes!

538
00:27:49,401 --> 00:27:51,707
This song is my favorite!

539
00:27:52,287 --> 00:27:53,340
Cheers!

540
00:27:54,320 --> 00:27:55,464
Cheers!

541
00:27:57,783 --> 00:27:59,491
Cheers!

542
00:28:01,339 --> 00:28:02,300
Hey, guys.

543
00:28:03,337 --> 00:28:04,271
Bottoms up?

544
00:28:04,271 --> 00:28:05,116
Bottoms up?

545
00:28:05,418 --> 00:28:06,428
Wanna do it?

546
00:28:06,692 --> 00:28:07,456
Sure!

547
00:28:07,456 --> 00:28:08,749
Let's go!

548
00:28:10,615 --> 00:28:12,033
I said let go of me!

549
00:28:12,033 --> 00:28:12,927
Let go of me!

550
00:28:13,606 --> 00:28:14,684
Damn it, let go!

551
00:28:22,961 --> 00:28:24,281
Sand! Arm!

552
00:28:24,658 --> 00:28:25,447
Hey!

553
00:28:25,447 --> 00:28:26,963
Guy is getting beaten.

554
00:28:26,963 --> 00:28:27,463
Huh?

555
00:28:28,745 --> 00:28:29,821
What's going on?

556
00:28:30,650 --> 00:28:31,150
It's Guy!

557
00:28:31,150 --> 00:28:32,316
Shit! Let's go!

558
00:28:35,823 --> 00:28:36,960
Stop it, assholes!

559
00:28:38,299 --> 00:28:39,751
Your friend was asking for it.

560
00:28:39,751 --> 00:28:40,644
Calm down, bro.

561
00:28:41,002 --> 00:28:41,902
Let's talk nicely.

562
00:28:41,902 --> 00:28:43,691
I warned him to stay away from my girl.

563
00:28:43,691 --> 00:28:44,975
This is the least of what he deserves.

564
00:28:47,992 --> 00:28:50,308
If your girl didn't play along,
there wouldn't be a problem.

565
00:28:50,459 --> 00:28:51,541
Shit!

566
00:28:51,541 --> 00:28:52,911
Shit!

567
00:28:54,664 --> 00:28:55,248
Shit!

568
00:28:56,794 --> 00:28:57,492
Sand!

569
00:29:01,169 --> 00:29:02,200
Arm!

570
00:29:13,284 --> 00:29:14,535
Arm!

571
00:29:17,024 --> 00:29:17,975
Arm!

572
00:29:18,757 --> 00:29:19,500
Arm!

573
00:29:19,495 --> 00:29:20,075
Hey.

574
00:29:21,189 --> 00:29:22,018
He's awake.

575
00:29:24,372 --> 00:29:25,058
Arm.

576
00:29:28,736 --> 00:29:29,236
Hey.

577
00:29:30,161 --> 00:29:30,922
Don't touch it.

578
00:29:32,795 --> 00:29:33,448
Arc.

579
00:29:34,583 --> 00:29:36,105
You're lucky you woke up.

580
00:29:37,135 --> 00:29:38,475
I almost called the monks for your funeral.

581
00:29:41,922 --> 00:29:43,316
Did you bring me to the hospital?

582
00:29:43,484 --> 00:29:44,253
This is hell.

583
00:29:44,589 --> 00:29:46,077
Look around.

584
00:29:46,077 --> 00:29:46,602
Look.

585
00:29:47,022 --> 00:29:48,273
I'll let you win today.

586
00:29:48,756 --> 00:29:50,196
I don't have the energy to bicker with you.

587
00:29:55,072 --> 00:29:57,407
Oh, where are my friends?

588
00:29:57,870 --> 00:29:59,525
After getting their wounds dressed, they left.

589
00:30:02,173 --> 00:30:04,914
What about the guys who hurt my friends?

590
00:30:05,208 --> 00:30:06,253
They're at the police station.

591
00:30:09,511 --> 00:30:10,671
Slowly.

592
00:30:15,379 --> 00:30:16,380
Are you okay?

593
00:30:17,200 --> 00:30:18,032
Yes.

594
00:30:18,957 --> 00:30:20,356
Can I go back to my dorm now?

595
00:30:21,029 --> 00:30:24,156
The doctor said you can once you wake up

596
00:30:24,156 --> 00:30:26,413
but are you sure you're okay?

597
00:30:26,539 --> 00:30:27,705
Does it still hurt anywhere?

598
00:30:28,209 --> 00:30:29,020
I'm fine.

599
00:30:30,302 --> 00:30:33,936
If all's fine, please excuse Pun and me.

600
00:30:35,344 --> 00:30:35,898
Okay.

601
00:30:36,718 --> 00:30:37,860
You're going to take it from here, right?

602
00:30:40,614 --> 00:30:41,553
By the way, Arm,

603
00:30:41,826 --> 00:30:45,313
if you guys want to go to Bang On again soon,
you must have me or Arc accompany you.

604
00:30:45,481 --> 00:30:47,329
Don't go by yourselves, got it?

605
00:30:48,317 --> 00:30:49,199
Yes, Jet.

606
00:30:49,619 --> 00:30:50,244
Thank you.

607
00:30:50,580 --> 00:30:51,386
We're going then.

608
00:30:51,596 --> 00:30:52,174
See you.

609
00:30:52,174 --> 00:30:52,791
Get well soon.

610
00:30:52,792 --> 00:30:53,701
Please take care of him.

611
00:30:54,163 --> 00:30:54,696
See you.

612
00:31:06,360 --> 00:31:07,349
I'm sorry.

613
00:31:08,484 --> 00:31:09,525
So you realize what you did was wrong?

614
00:31:11,185 --> 00:31:12,163
Yes,

615
00:31:12,815 --> 00:31:14,146
but I wasn't that wrong, was I?

616
00:31:14,734 --> 00:31:16,365
I didn't start the fight.

617
00:31:18,151 --> 00:31:20,551
But you look the worst out of all of them.

618
00:31:23,809 --> 00:31:24,973
Can you take me home?

619
00:31:27,915 --> 00:31:28,592
Sure.

620
00:31:30,042 --> 00:31:31,208
But you're sleeping in my room tonight.

621
00:31:32,616 --> 00:31:33,215
Why?

622
00:31:33,655 --> 00:31:35,023
Look at yourself.

623
00:31:35,191 --> 00:31:36,583
You look like a dog that got hit by a car.

624
00:31:37,150 --> 00:31:40,099
If you go back to your dorm and the guards see you,
they'll report it to the uni. What will you do then?

625
00:31:43,651 --> 00:31:44,739
You're clever as a dog.

626
00:31:47,113 --> 00:31:49,609
Do you want another red bruise
on the other side of your face?

627
00:31:50,576 --> 00:31:52,003
Don't scold me.

628
00:31:52,339 --> 00:31:53,533
I'm injured.

629
00:31:55,004 --> 00:31:57,578
Let's go so you can rest.

630
00:31:59,028 --> 00:31:59,598
Come on.

631
00:32:02,024 --> 00:32:02,857
Look at you.

632
00:32:06,598 --> 00:32:07,240
Ouch!

633
00:32:09,951 --> 00:32:11,417
Can I sleep on your bed?

634
00:32:12,594 --> 00:32:13,250
Yeah.

635
00:32:22,338 --> 00:32:23,830
Thank you for coming to help me.

636
00:32:24,095 --> 00:32:24,691
It's okay.

637
00:32:25,364 --> 00:32:26,916
My friends were the ones who helped talk it out.

638
00:32:27,483 --> 00:32:28,374
Yeah

639
00:32:29,089 --> 00:32:31,594
but I still want to thank you.

640
00:32:31,720 --> 00:32:32,496
Don't worry.

641
00:32:38,171 --> 00:32:39,428
Anyone who hurts you,

642
00:32:40,164 --> 00:32:41,381
I'll make them pay.

643
00:32:43,882 --> 00:32:44,917
That's so cruel.

644
00:32:45,758 --> 00:32:49,656
Now I feel lucky to be in the Perfect 10 Liners.

645
00:32:59,917 --> 00:33:00,897
By the way, Arm.

646
00:33:01,885 --> 00:33:02,476
Hmm?

647
00:33:03,401 --> 00:33:06,385
You told me that if I won the football game,

648
00:33:07,688 --> 00:33:09,267
you'd give me anything I ask for.

649
00:33:09,855 --> 00:33:13,117
Wow, you're bringing that up now?

650
00:33:15,450 --> 00:33:16,939
Please don't ask for anything expensive.

651
00:33:17,464 --> 00:33:19,387
I barely have enough money left to eat this month.

652
00:33:20,564 --> 00:33:21,474
It doesn't need money.

653
00:33:22,273 --> 00:33:22,903
Oh?

654
00:33:30,238 --> 00:33:31,946
I'm just asking you to keep yourself safe.

655
00:33:38,004 --> 00:33:39,418
I'm going to take a shower.

656
00:33:47,303 --> 00:33:47,917
Ouch!

657
00:34:06,805 --> 00:34:07,468
Hey.

658
00:34:08,225 --> 00:34:08,917
Are you awake?

659
00:34:10,640 --> 00:34:11,317
Yes.

660
00:34:11,632 --> 00:34:12,623
What time is your class?

661
00:34:13,190 --> 00:34:13,924
In the afternoon.

662
00:34:15,689 --> 00:34:16,805
Then get up and take a shower

663
00:34:16,805 --> 00:34:17,718
so you can eat.

664
00:34:18,117 --> 00:34:19,992
Can I go back to my room and change?

665
00:34:20,580 --> 00:34:23,134
I'm afraid I won't look handsome in your uniform.

666
00:34:24,059 --> 00:34:26,485
Yeah, your body is short.

667
00:34:27,515 --> 00:34:29,808
Yes, I'm short.

668
00:34:29,808 --> 00:34:30,620
Are you happy now?

669
00:34:31,671 --> 00:34:33,086
Being sarcastic is not cute.

670
00:34:33,653 --> 00:34:36,008
Take a shower here, then I'll drive you
to your dorm so you can change.

671
00:34:36,260 --> 00:34:37,063
Fine.

672
00:34:42,296 --> 00:34:45,510
Wow, did you really make all of these?

673
00:34:46,582 --> 00:34:48,625
Yeah, with my feet.

674
00:34:49,697 --> 00:34:50,848
Your feet are amazing.

675
00:34:50,848 --> 00:34:52,027
Do you want to kiss them?

676
00:34:52,658 --> 00:34:53,521
Come on.

677
00:34:54,173 --> 00:34:57,049
Am I not in a bad enough shape already?

678
00:35:00,811 --> 00:35:01,635
Can I eat now?

679
00:35:01,815 --> 00:35:03,303
Why don't you try sitting still?

680
00:35:03,450 --> 00:35:04,585
Maybe it will fly into your mouth.

681
00:35:06,787 --> 00:35:07,649
What will fly?

682
00:35:07,775 --> 00:35:08,574
My feet.

683
00:35:10,444 --> 00:35:11,021
I'm going to eat then.

684
00:35:11,021 --> 00:35:11,765
Go ahead.

685
00:35:19,415 --> 00:35:20,037
Hey.

686
00:35:21,802 --> 00:35:22,858
What happened to your hand?

687
00:35:24,771 --> 00:35:25,430
I don't know.

688
00:35:25,808 --> 00:35:27,191
It must've been when you fell in the field.

689
00:35:27,506 --> 00:35:28,113
Probably.

690
00:35:29,920 --> 00:35:31,939
How's your knee?

691
00:35:32,191 --> 00:35:32,765
Is it healed now?

692
00:35:32,765 --> 00:35:34,113
It's not as bad as the wound on your head.

693
00:35:35,542 --> 00:35:37,706
Hurry up and eat so we can go to your dorm.

694
00:35:39,871 --> 00:35:41,267
I only slept over for one night

695
00:35:41,729 --> 00:35:42,756
and you're already annoyed with me.

696
00:35:55,640 --> 00:35:57,076
Thank you for the ride.

697
00:35:57,559 --> 00:35:58,191
I'm going now.

698
00:36:10,895 --> 00:36:11,535
Wait.

699
00:36:13,279 --> 00:36:13,861
Arc?

700
00:36:15,185 --> 00:36:16,064
Oh, shit.

701
00:36:17,934 --> 00:36:18,725
Here's the second book.

702
00:36:19,860 --> 00:36:21,323
But you said you wanted me
to finish the first one first.

703
00:36:21,323 --> 00:36:21,935
Do you want it or not?

704
00:36:21,935 --> 00:36:23,035
Yes, I do.

705
00:36:30,895 --> 00:36:32,153
Ahem.

706
00:36:33,455 --> 00:36:35,484
Did you let your sweetheart borrow this book?

707
00:36:36,093 --> 00:36:36,626
What are you talking about?

708
00:36:37,257 --> 00:36:37,907
Here.

709
00:36:38,621 --> 00:36:40,103
“Anol's person.”

710
00:36:40,734 --> 00:36:41,385
Who's that?

711
00:36:41,490 --> 00:36:42,234
Tell me.

712
00:36:44,967 --> 00:36:46,216
I wrote that for you.

713
00:37:01,873 --> 00:37:02,620
I'm leaving.

714
00:37:06,784 --> 00:37:08,079
Arm!

715
00:37:10,622 --> 00:37:12,574
- You're still alive!
- You're still alive!

716
00:37:14,781 --> 00:37:16,053
You're still as handsome as ever.

717
00:37:21,496 --> 00:37:22,282
He's still alive.

718
00:37:22,895 --> 00:37:23,931
Survived, but disoriented.

719
00:37:27,588 --> 00:37:28,300
Hey.

720
00:37:29,267 --> 00:37:29,891
Hey.

721
00:37:31,299 --> 00:37:31,989
Shit.

722
00:37:34,895 --> 00:37:37,021
What's he daydreaming about?

723
00:37:37,504 --> 00:37:39,273
Does he have a concussion?

724
00:37:39,988 --> 00:37:42,663
Your friend doesn't even have a brain
to get affected.

725
00:37:42,663 --> 00:37:44,090
Right, I forgot.

726
00:37:46,055 --> 00:37:47,414
Shut up.

727
00:37:48,045 --> 00:37:50,944
I'm this hurt, but when I opened my eyes,
I saw none of your faces.

728
00:37:50,944 --> 00:37:51,640
Damn it.

729
00:37:51,808 --> 00:37:53,271
But you saw Arc's face, right?

730
00:37:54,448 --> 00:37:55,112
What are you talking about?

731
00:37:55,784 --> 00:37:57,214
How do you know I was with Arc?

732
00:37:57,697 --> 00:38:00,059
Because once he paid the fine,
he rushed to the hospital.

733
00:38:00,059 --> 00:38:02,536
He also sent us away
and told us he'd take care of you himself.

734
00:38:03,230 --> 00:38:03,778
The fine?

735
00:38:05,564 --> 00:38:06,408
What fine?

736
00:38:07,627 --> 00:38:09,343
The fine for physical assault.

737
00:38:10,646 --> 00:38:11,534
Physical assault?

738
00:38:12,690 --> 00:38:13,844
Who assaulted who?

739
00:38:15,399 --> 00:38:18,388
So he was with you all night
but didn't tell you anything?

740
00:38:18,850 --> 00:38:19,353
No.

741
00:38:21,095 --> 00:38:21,810
Hey!

742
00:38:22,693 --> 00:38:23,848
You're the one who hurt Arm, right?

743
00:38:31,078 --> 00:38:31,711
I'm sorry.

744
00:38:31,711 --> 00:38:32,695
I didn't know he was your guy.

745
00:38:33,031 --> 00:38:35,530
You better remember next time.

746
00:38:39,712 --> 00:38:40,371
Hey.

747
00:38:41,002 --> 00:38:42,021
Is the charge settled?

748
00:38:44,690 --> 00:38:45,362
Yeah,

749
00:38:46,266 --> 00:38:47,638
I've paid the fine.

750
00:38:47,890 --> 00:38:49,951
I thought you stopped being hot-headed.

751
00:38:52,895 --> 00:38:54,335
I tried to calm down, but…

752
00:38:54,335 --> 00:38:57,530
But Arm was hurt, right?

753
00:38:57,866 --> 00:38:58,944
That's why you couldn't let it slide.

754
00:39:00,436 --> 00:39:01,628
He's my peer mentee's mentee.

755
00:39:01,985 --> 00:39:02,609
What was I supposed to do?

756
00:39:02,609 --> 00:39:03,927
Your important peer mentee's mentee.

757
00:39:03,927 --> 00:39:04,471
Hey.

758
00:39:05,290 --> 00:39:07,735
Why are you pressuring me, Warm?

759
00:39:08,218 --> 00:39:10,922
I haven't seen you like this in a long while.

760
00:39:11,279 --> 00:39:12,056
What do you mean?

761
00:39:12,224 --> 00:39:13,039
I'm normal.

762
00:39:14,804 --> 00:39:15,486
Alright.

763
00:39:15,906 --> 00:39:17,257
If you say so.

764
00:39:19,590 --> 00:39:22,984
By the way, did anyone hear about last night?

765
00:39:22,984 --> 00:39:25,920
You mean the way
you beat the crap out of that guy at the bar?

766
00:39:25,920 --> 00:39:26,678
Warm!

767
00:39:27,140 --> 00:39:28,298
Why did you have to say it so loud?

768
00:39:28,298 --> 00:39:29,050
Are you afraid your junior will find out?

769
00:39:36,616 --> 00:39:37,811
It's too late for that.

770
00:39:54,555 --> 00:39:55,720
Isn't your class in the afternoon?

771
00:39:56,182 --> 00:39:56,883
Why are you early?

772
00:40:00,393 --> 00:40:05,096
You didn't hurt your hand by falling in the field,
but by punching someone, right?

773
00:40:08,228 --> 00:40:10,540
Why ask if you already know?

774
00:40:11,086 --> 00:40:14,222
Why didn't you tell me last night
that you dealt with those guys?

775
00:40:14,222 --> 00:40:15,403
Are you okay?

776
00:40:16,139 --> 00:40:17,070
It's just a brawl.

777
00:40:17,490 --> 00:40:18,801
I've paid the fine already.

778
00:40:19,873 --> 00:40:21,427
But you got into trouble because of me.

779
00:40:22,895 --> 00:40:27,080
Before I do anything,
I already expect the consequences.

780
00:40:27,668 --> 00:40:28,867
Yes, I know,

781
00:40:29,498 --> 00:40:30,772
but it was still dangerous.

782
00:40:30,898 --> 00:40:33,123
What if you slip up and they gang up on you?

783
00:40:33,459 --> 00:40:34,629
I'm fine, aren't I?

784
00:40:36,142 --> 00:40:38,351
Arc, you're just…

785
00:40:43,185 --> 00:40:44,469
Do you have bruises anywhere else?

786
00:40:44,469 --> 00:40:45,961
Hey.

787
00:40:45,961 --> 00:40:46,992
I'm fine.

788
00:40:46,992 --> 00:40:48,161
Are you that worried about me?

789
00:40:48,329 --> 00:40:49,229
I can take off my shirt and let you see.

790
00:40:49,229 --> 00:40:49,798
Hey!

791
00:40:50,534 --> 00:40:52,308
Don't do it, I believe you now.

792
00:40:55,166 --> 00:40:57,046
Next time, don't get hot-headed again, okay?

793
00:40:57,046 --> 00:40:58,185
Fine.

794
00:40:58,479 --> 00:41:00,407
Next time I get hot-headed,

795
00:41:00,617 --> 00:41:01,952
I'll save it.

796
00:41:02,267 --> 00:41:06,008
And if I really want to punch someone,
I'll punch your face.

797
00:41:06,386 --> 00:41:07,188
You're the worst.

798
00:41:07,924 --> 00:41:08,980
Alright, I'm leaving.

799
00:41:08,980 --> 00:41:09,804
I only came here to talk about that.

800
00:41:10,308 --> 00:41:10,942
Wait.

801
00:41:12,981 --> 00:41:13,944
- What?
- Where are you going?

802
00:41:14,343 --> 00:41:15,381
I'm going to find somewhere to sleep.

803
00:41:15,549 --> 00:41:16,611
I have class in the afternoon.

804
00:41:17,157 --> 00:41:18,423
So you came here early in the morning

805
00:41:18,948 --> 00:41:20,599
just to talk to me about that?

806
00:41:21,124 --> 00:41:21,834
Yeah.

807
00:41:23,137 --> 00:41:24,483
You want somewhere to sleep, right?

808
00:41:29,927 --> 00:41:30,778
Hi, guys.

809
00:41:31,030 --> 00:41:31,665
Hi.

810
00:41:40,142 --> 00:41:41,277
The teacher for this class is not strict.

811
00:41:41,992 --> 00:41:43,176
You can just sleep here.

812
00:41:45,425 --> 00:41:46,320
Fine.

813
00:41:46,895 --> 00:41:48,096
At least it's air-conditioned.

814
00:41:53,975 --> 00:41:54,536
Hey.

815
00:41:59,706 --> 00:42:00,849
Sleep on the other side.

816
00:42:01,332 --> 00:42:02,561
This side will hurt.

817
00:42:04,789 --> 00:42:06,688
Oh, I forgot.

818
00:42:42,811 --> 00:42:44,794
Whoa, look.

819
00:42:49,964 --> 00:42:52,462
Is he just his peer mentee's mentee?

820
00:42:53,240 --> 00:42:53,924
I don't know.

821
00:42:54,200 --> 00:42:55,073
You have to wait and see.

822
00:43:07,452 --> 00:43:08,624
What building is your class in?

823
00:43:09,939 --> 00:43:10,969
The central building.

824
00:43:11,488 --> 00:43:12,413
The central building?

825
00:43:16,727 --> 00:43:18,059
Arc is free.

826
00:43:18,189 --> 00:43:19,010
Do you want him to walk you there?

827
00:43:19,862 --> 00:43:20,792
It's okay.

828
00:43:21,014 --> 00:43:22,749
It's just nearby. I can walk there myself.

829
00:43:25,615 --> 00:43:26,378
I'm going.

830
00:43:26,508 --> 00:43:27,180
Bye.

831
00:43:27,346 --> 00:43:27,946
Bye.

832
00:43:34,242 --> 00:43:35,095
What's wrong with you?

833
00:43:35,391 --> 00:43:36,311
I tried to help you just now.

834
00:43:44,218 --> 00:43:44,718
Oh.

835
00:43:47,367 --> 00:43:47,867
Hey.

836
00:43:52,663 --> 00:43:54,837
Where's Arc?

837
00:43:55,633 --> 00:43:56,382
We split.

838
00:43:56,826 --> 00:43:57,998
Whose jacket are you wearing?

839
00:43:58,165 --> 00:43:58,793
Arc's.

840
00:43:59,756 --> 00:44:00,481
Shit.

841
00:44:06,685 --> 00:44:07,790
Come on.

842
00:44:07,994 --> 00:44:09,469
You're keeping an open secret.

843
00:44:09,469 --> 00:44:10,404
It's not a secret.

844
00:44:10,404 --> 00:44:10,934
Right.

845
00:44:13,212 --> 00:44:14,393
Let's go to class, guys.

846
00:44:14,393 --> 00:44:15,176
We're late.

847
00:44:15,732 --> 00:44:16,351
I'm lazy.

848
00:44:16,536 --> 00:44:17,326
Don't be sleepy now.

849
00:44:17,456 --> 00:44:18,117
Sand!

850
00:44:18,117 --> 00:44:19,175
Carry my bag.

851
00:44:19,175 --> 00:44:19,675
Come on!

852
00:44:19,675 --> 00:44:20,310
I'm not going.

853
00:44:20,310 --> 00:44:21,375
- We're late!
- We're late!

854
00:44:27,560 --> 00:44:28,649
I don't have any energy left.

855
00:44:34,667 --> 00:44:35,199
Arm.

856
00:44:37,958 --> 00:44:39,031
Arm!

857
00:44:39,364 --> 00:44:40,247
The class is over.

858
00:44:41,637 --> 00:44:42,201
Oh.

859
00:44:42,812 --> 00:44:43,373
Shit.

860
00:44:43,521 --> 00:44:46,124
Do you have to watch Arc play football today?

861
00:44:47,050 --> 00:44:48,390
I have to go every time.

862
00:44:53,205 --> 00:44:54,972
[DON'T GO TO THE FIELD THIS EVENING.]

863
00:44:55,120 --> 00:44:55,875
[I HAVE LAB.]

864
00:44:56,171 --> 00:44:58,877
Well, I don't have to go anymore.

865
00:44:59,803 --> 00:45:00,392
Oh?

866
00:45:11,596 --> 00:45:12,292
I'm sorry.

867
00:45:12,662 --> 00:45:16,073
The situation was desperate, so I…

868
00:45:16,073 --> 00:45:16,965
So you got physical.

869
00:45:17,928 --> 00:45:19,964
No, you have to listen to the whole story.

870
00:45:20,112 --> 00:45:21,276
Arc already told me.

871
00:45:35,394 --> 00:45:36,866
What if something worse had happened to you?

872
00:45:38,526 --> 00:45:39,719
Don't do that again,

873
00:45:41,423 --> 00:45:42,772
or I'll really be angry.

874
00:45:49,587 --> 00:45:51,793
So this means you're not angry this time.

875
00:45:52,515 --> 00:45:53,754
What a relief.

876
00:45:54,754 --> 00:45:55,901
Stop smiling.

877
00:45:56,531 --> 00:45:58,040
I was worried, you know?

878
00:45:58,947 --> 00:46:00,291
Yes, I know.

879
00:46:00,291 --> 00:46:01,230
I won't do that again.

880
00:46:01,230 --> 00:46:02,109
I'm sorry.

881
00:46:04,664 --> 00:46:05,333
Does it hurt?

882
00:46:06,000 --> 00:46:07,854
No, it's far from my heart.

883
00:46:07,854 --> 00:46:08,396
Okay.

884
00:46:08,975 --> 00:46:09,975
Ouch!

885
00:46:11,290 --> 00:46:12,146
Pond!

886
00:46:12,387 --> 00:46:13,371
You said it doesn't hurt.

887
00:46:14,612 --> 00:46:16,574
No, this one hurts a bit.

888
00:46:16,574 --> 00:46:17,844
But this one doesn't hurt at all.

889
00:46:18,511 --> 00:46:19,252
One more time?

890
00:46:19,845 --> 00:46:20,798
I'm leaving.

891
00:46:21,187 --> 00:46:22,527
No one's driving me home.

892
00:46:22,527 --> 00:46:23,402
I'm so lonely.

893
00:46:23,575 --> 00:46:24,244
Let's go.

894
00:46:37,903 --> 00:46:38,426
What are you doing?

895
00:46:44,241 --> 00:46:44,995
What are you doing here?

896
00:46:45,328 --> 00:46:46,062
I'm here to see you.

897
00:46:49,025 --> 00:46:50,591
I came to return your jacket.

898
00:46:51,591 --> 00:46:53,531
I accidentally took it
but you didn't say anything.

899
00:46:53,827 --> 00:46:54,800
It's only a few hundred baht.

900
00:46:54,800 --> 00:46:55,724
I can get a new one.

901
00:46:56,095 --> 00:46:57,416
Yes, you're rich.

902
00:46:58,675 --> 00:47:01,571
Are you leaving soon?

903
00:47:06,052 --> 00:47:06,961
In a while.

904
00:47:07,443 --> 00:47:08,114
Why do you ask?

905
00:47:08,614 --> 00:47:09,170
Can I leave with you?

906
00:47:10,117 --> 00:47:12,140
It was so quiet on my way here.

907
00:47:12,140 --> 00:47:13,443
It'll be scary late at night.

908
00:47:14,610 --> 00:47:15,538
I'm afraid of ghosts.

909
00:47:18,056 --> 00:47:18,806
In that case,

910
00:47:20,658 --> 00:47:21,746
you can sleep over there while you wait.

911
00:47:21,968 --> 00:47:22,923
I'll wake you up once I'm done.

912
00:47:23,415 --> 00:47:24,408
Sleep again?

913
00:47:25,019 --> 00:47:26,474
I just woke up earlier.

914
00:47:49,471 --> 00:47:52,640
But I've never seen him close with anyone

915
00:47:53,325 --> 00:47:54,703
like he's with you, Arm.

916
00:47:58,495 --> 00:47:59,232
It can't be true.

917
00:48:13,528 --> 00:48:16,983
Don't you realize that
Arc is trying to get closer to you?

918
00:48:20,687 --> 00:48:23,664
You know that we're a close-knit group.

919
00:48:24,831 --> 00:48:28,102
He's probably just looking after me
like he always does for everyone in the group.

920
00:48:28,621 --> 00:48:30,865
But when Arc found out you were badly hurt,

921
00:48:30,958 --> 00:48:32,527
he was so angry.

922
00:48:32,675 --> 00:48:33,878
He was so scary

923
00:48:33,878 --> 00:48:35,490
that even Jet didn't even dare stop him.

924
00:48:35,490 --> 00:48:35,990
Yeah.

925
00:48:37,138 --> 00:48:37,762
Really?

926
00:48:37,762 --> 00:48:38,309
Yes.

927
00:48:38,902 --> 00:48:39,528
Okay.

928
00:48:40,195 --> 00:48:42,885
Whether Arc likes you or not doesn't matter now.

929
00:48:45,478 --> 00:48:47,585
How do you feel about him?

930
00:48:50,363 --> 00:48:50,951
Arm.

931
00:48:52,284 --> 00:48:52,888
Arm.

932
00:49:06,137 --> 00:49:06,791
We can leave now.

933
00:49:10,439 --> 00:49:10,939
Arc.

934
00:49:23,875 --> 00:49:24,375
Um,

935
00:49:25,986 --> 00:49:28,462
Can I ask you something?

936
00:49:30,295 --> 00:49:30,867
Yeah.

937
00:49:32,645 --> 00:49:33,228
Ask away.

938
00:49:34,580 --> 00:49:39,737
What you wrote on the cover of the calculus book,

939
00:49:40,885 --> 00:49:43,951
you said it was for me.

940
00:49:44,303 --> 00:49:46,629
What does that mean?

941
00:49:55,700 --> 00:49:57,072
I meant exactly what I wrote.

942
00:49:59,479 --> 00:50:00,339
What does it mean?

943
00:50:01,876 --> 00:50:05,088
You mean I'm your person?

944
00:50:18,569 --> 00:50:19,489
Do you want to be?

945
00:50:27,914 --> 00:50:28,665
If you don't answer,

946
00:50:30,776 --> 00:50:31,986
I'll take that as a yes.

947
00:51:23,514 --> 00:51:24,642
You'll get it soon.

948
00:51:25,790 --> 00:51:26,582
No need to rush.

949
00:51:46,074 --> 00:51:47,226
Are you avoiding me?

950
00:51:47,226 --> 00:51:48,430
You kissed me!

951
00:51:48,430 --> 00:51:49,839
Do you want to kiss me back?

952
00:51:50,098 --> 00:51:51,784
You don't sound like the Arc I know.

953
00:51:51,784 --> 00:51:55,271
Did Arc make you so angry you're blushing?

954
00:51:55,415 --> 00:51:56,022
Sand,

955
00:51:56,022 --> 00:51:57,096
you're getting a good one.

956
00:51:57,096 --> 00:51:57,659
I'm hitting on you.

957
00:51:57,659 --> 00:51:58,517
Don't you realize it at all?

958
00:51:58,591 --> 00:52:00,287
I'm going out of town tomorrow.

959
00:52:00,495 --> 00:52:01,515
Are you going with Arc?

960
00:52:01,515 --> 00:52:03,252
Pun sent me Tawan's address.

961
00:52:03,252 --> 00:52:04,530
It's on a beach near Bangkok.

962
00:52:04,753 --> 00:52:05,618
Let's play in the water.

963
00:52:05,618 --> 00:52:06,364
Come on!

964
00:52:08,271 --> 00:52:10,021
Arm, do you trust me?

965
00:52:11,225 --> 00:52:12,962
I'll lead you forward.
