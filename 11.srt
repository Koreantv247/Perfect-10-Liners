1
00:00:02,560 --> 00:00:03,990
Hi, new roommate.

2
00:00:04,380 --> 00:00:08,400
Actually, I’ve heard things
about Yotha from Arc’s friends.

3
00:00:08,430 --> 00:00:10,910
People on the outside
aren’t saying nice things about Yotha.

4
00:00:10,940 --> 00:00:12,410
You’ve grown so much, little brother.

5
00:00:13,870 --> 00:00:15,260
I want to get to know you better.

6
00:00:15,930 --> 00:00:16,960
I got an internship.

7
00:00:16,980 --> 00:00:19,430
I’ll have to move to Rayong for 3 months.

8
00:00:19,460 --> 00:00:20,640
It’s just Rayong.

9
00:00:20,670 --> 00:00:22,640
Let the feeling of missing do its magic.

10
00:00:23,720 --> 00:00:24,880
When you see me,

11
00:00:24,910 --> 00:00:26,440
what’s the first thing you think of?

12
00:00:26,570 --> 00:00:27,100
A dog.

13
00:00:27,120 --> 00:00:28,290
Do I really look like a dog?

14
00:00:28,310 --> 00:00:29,070
Oeagle.

15
00:00:29,080 --> 00:00:30,480
Beagle, you jerk.

16
00:00:30,510 --> 00:00:31,810
Looking like a dog

17
00:00:31,840 --> 00:00:32,940
is not a bad thing.

18
00:00:33,120 --> 00:00:33,900
It’s cute.

19
00:00:37,820 --> 00:00:39,900
The dorm is so quiet.

20
00:00:40,130 --> 00:00:41,530
There’s no one left.

21
00:00:42,890 --> 00:00:44,060
When will Monday come?

22
00:00:44,550 --> 00:00:47,320
I want to have friends.

23
00:00:51,630 --> 00:00:53,900
I mean, I want more friends.

24
00:00:53,920 --> 00:00:55,360
A few more.

25
00:01:03,580 --> 00:01:04,410
Hello.

26
00:01:05,660 --> 00:01:06,730
No, I’m not doing anything.

27
00:01:06,750 --> 00:01:07,660
I’m at my dorm.

28
00:01:08,620 --> 00:01:09,610
Sure,

29
00:01:10,740 --> 00:01:12,800
but can I bring Gun?

30
00:01:15,500 --> 00:01:15,920
Me?

31
00:01:15,940 --> 00:01:16,670
Where are we going?

32
00:01:17,260 --> 00:01:17,890
Okay.

33
00:01:18,130 --> 00:01:19,310
See you in half an hour.

34
00:01:20,040 --> 00:01:21,010
Where are we going?

35
00:01:23,010 --> 00:01:25,520
Arm invited me out for a meal and a movie.

36
00:01:26,030 --> 00:01:28,030
Maybe he only wants to invite his group.

37
00:01:28,050 --> 00:01:30,120
I don’t like being around
people I’m not close with for too long.

38
00:01:30,140 --> 00:01:31,000
It’s uncomfortable.

39
00:01:31,600 --> 00:01:32,950
Would bringing me help?

40
00:01:33,790 --> 00:01:35,150
I wouldn’t be bringing you if it didn’t.

41
00:01:35,160 --> 00:01:36,120
Go get ready.

42
00:01:36,160 --> 00:01:37,890
We need to be at the mall in half an hour.

43
00:01:41,950 --> 00:01:44,100
Does this mean
I’ve been upgraded to your best friend?

44
00:01:45,230 --> 00:01:46,320
Go get ready.

45
00:01:46,340 --> 00:01:47,610
Answer me.

46
00:01:47,630 --> 00:01:48,590
We’re close now, right?

47
00:02:07,610 --> 00:02:10,260
I told you to get ready, Beagle.

48
00:02:14,040 --> 00:02:15,100
Okay.

49
00:04:09,670 --> 00:04:11,010
Hey, Yotha.

50
00:04:11,040 --> 00:04:11,820
Hi.

51
00:04:11,840 --> 00:04:13,000
Hey, guys.

52
00:04:13,810 --> 00:04:15,170
Can I tag along today?

53
00:04:15,900 --> 00:04:16,610
Of course.

54
00:04:16,620 --> 00:04:17,900
The more, the merrier.

55
00:04:21,350 --> 00:04:24,120
What movie should we watch?

56
00:04:37,180 --> 00:04:39,820
Why did that dog have to die?

57
00:04:40,150 --> 00:04:40,990
I know, right?

58
00:04:42,710 --> 00:04:44,920
The poster looked so cheerful.

59
00:04:44,950 --> 00:04:46,740
We shouldn't have fallen for it.

60
00:04:57,370 --> 00:04:58,960
Enjoy, Yotha, Gun.

61
00:04:59,600 --> 00:05:01,160
I won’t hold back then.

62
00:05:08,580 --> 00:05:10,770
Arc, I need to pee.

63
00:05:11,720 --> 00:05:12,370
Go ahead.

64
00:05:13,350 --> 00:05:14,400
Does anyone else need to pee?

65
00:05:15,230 --> 00:05:15,870
Me.

66
00:05:17,340 --> 00:05:17,910
Wanna go?

67
00:05:18,840 --> 00:05:19,730
Let’s go.

68
00:05:19,750 --> 00:05:20,600
I really need to pee.

69
00:05:26,130 --> 00:05:27,520
Hey, Yotha.

70
00:05:28,720 --> 00:05:29,320
Yes?

71
00:05:29,670 --> 00:05:32,560
I have a favor to ask.

72
00:05:37,210 --> 00:05:39,220
Is there anything else you want to do?

73
00:05:39,240 --> 00:05:40,900
Do you want some dessert or maybe walk around?

74
00:05:41,310 --> 00:05:42,420
Hmm.

75
00:05:42,450 --> 00:05:44,140
I’m actually up for anything.

76
00:05:44,160 --> 00:05:46,040
Let’s ask Arc and Yotha.

77
00:05:47,150 --> 00:05:49,150
How’s it going?

78
00:05:49,180 --> 00:05:50,780
Have you gotten any closer to Yotha?

79
00:05:55,020 --> 00:05:57,360
I don’t like being around
people I’m not close with for too long.

80
00:05:57,380 --> 00:05:58,230
It’s uncomfortable.

81
00:05:58,550 --> 00:06:00,000
Would bringing me help?

82
00:06:00,800 --> 00:06:02,120
I wouldn’t be bringing you if it didn’t.

83
00:06:02,140 --> 00:06:03,130
Go get ready.

84
00:06:03,150 --> 00:06:04,690
We need to be at the mall in half an hour.

85
00:06:07,740 --> 00:06:09,230
I’m closer to him now.

86
00:06:09,980 --> 00:06:10,900
That’s great.

87
00:06:10,920 --> 00:06:13,370
I’ve been trying to break down his walls too,

88
00:06:13,850 --> 00:06:16,450
but it’s a bit hard, don’t you think?

89
00:06:16,820 --> 00:06:18,100
It’s really hard.

90
00:06:18,540 --> 00:06:21,460
I’m looking for the right moment to warn him about that.

91
00:06:22,160 --> 00:06:24,870
But at least Yotha said he wouldn’t lie.

92
00:06:25,410 --> 00:06:27,600
If he doesn’t want me to know something,
he just won’t tell me.

93
00:06:27,610 --> 00:06:28,620
That’s it.

94
00:06:29,260 --> 00:06:31,100
So mysterious.

95
00:06:34,030 --> 00:06:35,570
In the second semester,

96
00:06:35,600 --> 00:06:37,230
I’m going to intern in another city.

97
00:06:37,820 --> 00:06:39,010
While I’m away,

98
00:06:39,560 --> 00:06:41,470
just don’t get my boyfriend into trouble.

99
00:06:42,860 --> 00:06:44,210
What do you mean?

100
00:06:46,320 --> 00:06:48,940
When you get into fights while I’m here,

101
00:06:48,970 --> 00:06:50,700
I can help settle things.

102
00:06:51,040 --> 00:06:53,890
Okay, yes, I’m worried about my boyfriend.

103
00:06:53,920 --> 00:06:57,180
I know that if he finds out you’re in trouble,

104
00:06:57,210 --> 00:06:58,570
he won’t just stand by.

105
00:07:00,290 --> 00:07:03,710
Yotha, I understand it’s your personal life,

106
00:07:03,730 --> 00:07:06,950
and I’m not here to tell you what to do or not to do.

107
00:07:07,440 --> 00:07:10,160
It’s fine if you don’t love yourself

108
00:07:10,910 --> 00:07:12,910
but you need to look at the people around you

109
00:07:12,930 --> 00:07:14,600
and how much trouble you’re causing them.

110
00:07:19,750 --> 00:07:21,880
Don’t wait until you’re hurt

111
00:07:22,870 --> 00:07:24,700
because it’s too late to fix anything.

112
00:07:26,530 --> 00:07:27,890
Thank you for warning me.

113
00:07:29,880 --> 00:07:30,520
Yeah.

114
00:07:40,610 --> 00:07:42,210
Why are you all here today?

115
00:07:42,230 --> 00:07:43,520
It’s my bar too.

116
00:07:44,060 --> 00:07:45,660
Can’t I come in and check on things?

117
00:07:45,680 --> 00:07:47,550
Normally, you leave me to run it alone.

118
00:07:47,870 --> 00:07:49,890
I just came to visit.

119
00:07:49,910 --> 00:07:52,170
He’s the one you should ask.

120
00:07:52,400 --> 00:07:54,460
He’s been drinking nonstop.

121
00:07:56,680 --> 00:07:58,130
Did you fight with Klao again?

122
00:07:59,190 --> 00:08:00,170
As usual.

123
00:08:00,660 --> 00:08:02,730
You should try dating someone older instead.

124
00:08:02,760 --> 00:08:04,730
With Yotha, who’s several years younger than you,

125
00:08:04,750 --> 00:08:06,100
I can understand.

126
00:08:06,120 --> 00:08:09,070
But Klao is only a few years younger,

127
00:08:09,100 --> 00:08:10,720
and you still can’t communicate.

128
00:08:10,760 --> 00:08:12,720
Are you trying to break us up?

129
00:08:14,890 --> 00:08:15,840
Tell me honestly.

130
00:08:16,430 --> 00:08:18,410
Are things really good with Klao

131
00:08:18,440 --> 00:08:20,410
or are you just dating him to forget Yotha?

132
00:08:21,500 --> 00:08:22,700
Are you guys crazy?

133
00:08:22,720 --> 00:08:25,400
I met Klao long after breaking up with Yotha.

134
00:08:25,420 --> 00:08:27,490
Klao and Yotha are different.

135
00:08:27,830 --> 00:08:29,220
Do whatever you want.

136
00:08:29,250 --> 00:08:30,870
I can always drink with you.

137
00:08:32,160 --> 00:08:33,450
Come on. Cheers.

138
00:08:37,450 --> 00:08:38,180
Hey.

139
00:08:47,620 --> 00:08:49,230
I said we should talk tomorrow.

140
00:08:49,960 --> 00:08:51,820
Can’t I come to apologize?

141
00:08:54,190 --> 00:08:54,970
What?

142
00:08:55,660 --> 00:08:57,070
I was being hot-headed.

143
00:08:57,990 --> 00:08:59,990
I was acting like a child,
which is what you don’t like.

144
00:09:01,830 --> 00:09:02,830
I feel guilty,

145
00:09:04,350 --> 00:09:05,660
so I wanted to come here and apologize.

146
00:09:07,660 --> 00:09:09,260
But if you don’t want to hear it today,

147
00:09:10,750 --> 00:09:12,210
I can come back another day.

148
00:09:15,860 --> 00:09:16,540
Klao.

149
00:09:27,780 --> 00:09:29,180
I didn’t drive here today.

150
00:09:36,460 --> 00:09:39,570
Then I’ll give you a ride.

151
00:10:09,420 --> 00:10:10,850
My fried chicken doesn’t taste good anymore.

152
00:10:10,880 --> 00:10:13,730
Just like me, it’s like yesterday’s leftovers.

153
00:10:13,760 --> 00:10:15,050
Those two are always like that.

154
00:10:15,910 --> 00:10:16,800
You know it.

155
00:10:16,830 --> 00:10:17,610
Yeah,

156
00:10:18,430 --> 00:10:19,880
I’ll mind my own business next time.

157
00:10:29,130 --> 00:10:31,280
I thought this weekend would be boring.

158
00:10:32,170 --> 00:10:34,310
Thanks for inviting me out.

159
00:10:37,930 --> 00:10:39,230
You can take a shower first.

160
00:10:39,260 --> 00:10:41,630
I’ll just lie down and be lazy for five minutes.

161
00:10:54,960 --> 00:10:56,960
I’m still not used to seeing you in that pajama set.

162
00:10:59,470 --> 00:11:00,210
What’s wrong with it?

163
00:11:00,650 --> 00:11:02,990
It doesn’t suit you at all.

164
00:11:10,280 --> 00:11:11,080
What?

165
00:11:11,290 --> 00:11:13,880
I want to know if yellow suits Beagle.

166
00:11:20,990 --> 00:11:21,880
What do you think?

167
00:11:22,320 --> 00:11:24,490
Does this tiger-printed pajama set suit a dog like me?

168
00:11:26,800 --> 00:11:29,360
But I think I wear it better than you.

169
00:11:29,780 --> 00:11:30,530
You think?

170
00:11:36,530 --> 00:11:37,770
Don’t I look handsome?

171
00:11:46,090 --> 00:11:47,400
Can I keep this pajama set?

172
00:11:48,600 --> 00:11:49,300
Why?

173
00:11:50,880 --> 00:11:54,210
I’ll wear it when you’re in a bad mood.

174
00:12:04,800 --> 00:12:05,670
What did you say?

175
00:12:07,360 --> 00:12:08,140
Well,

176
00:12:09,300 --> 00:12:12,640
you just smiled widely
for the first time since we’ve known each other.

177
00:12:14,790 --> 00:12:15,950
Can you smile more often?

178
00:12:15,980 --> 00:12:17,280
I like it.

179
00:12:19,810 --> 00:12:21,390
No one has ever said anything like that to me.

180
00:12:22,780 --> 00:12:23,630
Why?

181
00:12:24,590 --> 00:12:25,710
You don’t like it?

182
00:12:26,410 --> 00:12:27,870
Are you going to punch me?

183
00:12:28,080 --> 00:12:29,710
No one has ever paid attention to me

184
00:12:31,250 --> 00:12:33,250
or noticed how I feel.

185
00:12:34,010 --> 00:12:36,960
I don’t know what you’ve been through

186
00:12:37,440 --> 00:12:38,910
but if you try opening up,

187
00:12:39,560 --> 00:12:43,900
I’ll find many more ways to make you smile.

188
00:12:43,920 --> 00:12:44,700
Okay?

189
00:12:46,910 --> 00:12:48,600
Why are you doing this?

190
00:12:58,140 --> 00:12:59,380
Well…

191
00:13:01,790 --> 00:13:02,800
Well…

192
00:13:02,820 --> 00:13:03,690
Well what?

193
00:13:04,730 --> 00:13:07,200
I just want to make the people around me happy.

194
00:13:15,190 --> 00:13:16,910
Am I one of the people around you?

195
00:13:18,460 --> 00:13:19,660
Why are you asking this?

196
00:13:20,430 --> 00:13:21,510
Just answer.

197
00:13:22,090 --> 00:13:24,680
Of course, you are.

198
00:13:27,050 --> 00:13:29,120
The people next to me,

199
00:13:29,440 --> 00:13:30,350
in front of me,

200
00:13:30,670 --> 00:13:31,550
or behind me

201
00:13:32,200 --> 00:13:33,670
are all people around me.

202
00:13:37,980 --> 00:13:39,120
Do you care about me?

203
00:13:40,920 --> 00:13:41,770
What?

204
00:13:51,660 --> 00:13:52,490
Forget it.

205
00:13:52,500 --> 00:13:53,600
Let’s sleep.

206
00:13:54,370 --> 00:13:55,870
Don’t have nightmares, Beagle.

207
00:13:57,130 --> 00:13:57,690
Oh.

208
00:14:01,420 --> 00:14:02,330
Okay.

209
00:14:02,340 --> 00:14:03,720
Don’t have nightmares.

210
00:14:07,450 --> 00:14:08,840
There, you’re secretly looking at me.

211
00:14:09,510 --> 00:14:11,040
Close your eyes already.

212
00:14:14,540 --> 00:14:15,590
Beagle.

213
00:14:23,880 --> 00:14:26,740
You guys heard they’re making us start wearing

214
00:14:26,770 --> 00:14:29,320
the jacket in the second semester this year, right?

215
00:14:29,340 --> 00:14:30,080
Really?

216
00:14:30,400 --> 00:14:31,420
I didn’t know.

217
00:14:31,920 --> 00:14:33,360
How come?

218
00:14:33,600 --> 00:14:34,990
It’s all over our group chat.

219
00:14:35,000 --> 00:14:35,890
Do you ever read the messages?

220
00:14:35,920 --> 00:14:36,660
No.

221
00:14:36,680 --> 00:14:38,310
It’s a lot. I’m too lazy.

222
00:14:38,330 --> 00:14:39,880
Come on.

223
00:14:40,240 --> 00:14:41,280
That’s good.

224
00:14:41,660 --> 00:14:43,450
We’ll look cool one semester early.

225
00:14:43,470 --> 00:14:44,630
Nothing can make you look cool.

226
00:14:44,660 --> 00:14:47,380
Whoa.

227
00:14:47,400 --> 00:14:48,130
Just kidding.

228
00:14:48,350 --> 00:14:50,140
His brows are twitching.

229
00:14:50,160 --> 00:14:51,120
I’m just kidding.

230
00:14:51,150 --> 00:14:52,330
That’s harsh.

231
00:14:53,090 --> 00:14:54,800
Just kidding.

232
00:14:55,790 --> 00:14:56,610
Beagle.

233
00:14:57,260 --> 00:14:58,570
Hmm? What’s up?

234
00:14:59,760 --> 00:15:01,000
Hi, Yotha.

235
00:15:04,430 --> 00:15:05,400
Hi, Yotha.

236
00:15:05,930 --> 00:15:06,910
Tie my necktie for me.

237
00:15:08,220 --> 00:15:08,850
Sure.

238
00:15:10,700 --> 00:15:12,140
What did he just call him?

239
00:15:14,640 --> 00:15:15,880
Beagle.

240
00:15:18,500 --> 00:15:20,410
I was looking for your tie this morning.

241
00:15:20,430 --> 00:15:21,690
I was going to tie it for you as usual.

242
00:15:21,710 --> 00:15:23,410
- I think I heard that somewhere.
- But I couldn’t find it

243
00:15:23,440 --> 00:15:24,990
and I didn’t want to open your closet.

244
00:15:27,080 --> 00:15:28,430
It’s a dog’s name.

245
00:15:34,970 --> 00:15:36,550
Is he using our friend as a dog?

246
00:15:40,550 --> 00:15:41,430
Done.

247
00:15:41,790 --> 00:15:42,650
You look handsome now.

248
00:15:54,880 --> 00:15:55,610
Is this

249
00:15:55,640 --> 00:15:56,200
What you two

250
00:15:56,220 --> 00:15:57,560
Normally do?

251
00:15:58,620 --> 00:15:59,440
Yeah.

252
00:15:59,470 --> 00:16:00,560
Why are you guys shocked?

253
00:16:01,270 --> 00:16:03,510
Damn, Gun.

254
00:16:03,830 --> 00:16:05,390
You’re so brave.

255
00:16:05,400 --> 00:16:08,620
Yotha walking over here just now

256
00:16:10,080 --> 00:16:11,630
gave me goosebumps already.

257
00:16:11,650 --> 00:16:13,530
Don’t you feel uncomfortable around him?

258
00:16:13,850 --> 00:16:15,920
Are you sure this is normal, Ears?

259
00:16:16,680 --> 00:16:18,410
We’re roommates.

260
00:16:18,430 --> 00:16:19,750
We sleep in the same room every night.

261
00:16:19,780 --> 00:16:20,840
It’d be weird if that didn’t make us close.

262
00:16:23,720 --> 00:16:25,120
Come on. Get up.

263
00:16:25,160 --> 00:16:26,270
We don’t want to be late for the attendance check.

264
00:16:26,290 --> 00:16:26,930
Let’s go.

265
00:16:30,130 --> 00:16:31,720
Come on. Get up.

266
00:16:31,740 --> 00:16:32,570
Okay.

267
00:16:32,600 --> 00:16:34,120
Why does he have to call him Beagle?

268
00:16:34,150 --> 00:16:35,070
Come on!

269
00:16:35,090 --> 00:16:36,300
Coming!

270
00:16:42,570 --> 00:16:43,870
Hey.

271
00:16:44,250 --> 00:16:45,900
I thought I wouldn’t see you guys in class again.

272
00:16:46,070 --> 00:16:48,240
We’ve seen you for three weeks.

273
00:16:48,270 --> 00:16:50,050
You just haven't seen us.

274
00:16:50,410 --> 00:16:51,720
Sorry.

275
00:16:51,740 --> 00:16:53,370
I just have so many friends.

276
00:16:53,400 --> 00:16:54,620
Of course.

277
00:16:54,650 --> 00:16:56,870
Only the uni president is not your friend.

278
00:16:57,330 --> 00:16:58,330
I have his LINE ID.

279
00:16:58,360 --> 00:16:58,920
What?

280
00:16:58,940 --> 00:17:00,030
But he rarely replies to me.

281
00:17:00,050 --> 00:17:00,400
Wow.

282
00:17:02,490 --> 00:17:03,310
Of course.

283
00:17:03,700 --> 00:17:06,230
Hey, have you guys filled out the profile form?

284
00:17:06,370 --> 00:17:06,880
Huh?

285
00:17:07,290 --> 00:17:08,880
What profile form?

286
00:17:10,700 --> 00:17:12,640
The one from the uni.

287
00:17:12,670 --> 00:17:14,640
A teacher asked Yotha to hand it out.

288
00:17:15,550 --> 00:17:17,680
Which teacher asked him to do that?

289
00:17:18,300 --> 00:17:19,880
What profile?

290
00:17:21,240 --> 00:17:23,040
General information.

291
00:17:23,070 --> 00:17:25,420
Like favorite color,

292
00:17:25,450 --> 00:17:26,380
favorite food,

293
00:17:26,380 --> 00:17:27,890
address…

294
00:17:27,920 --> 00:17:29,320
The basics.

295
00:17:29,920 --> 00:17:31,500
What does the uni need that info for?

296
00:17:32,060 --> 00:17:34,180
Oh.

297
00:17:34,800 --> 00:17:37,420
That info you filled out wasn’t for the uni.

298
00:17:38,160 --> 00:17:39,710
Huh? Then who?

299
00:17:39,730 --> 00:17:41,260
It’s for Yotha to read.

300
00:17:42,560 --> 00:17:43,300
What?

301
00:17:44,570 --> 00:17:46,070
Congrats, buddy.

302
00:17:46,090 --> 00:17:47,850
You’re the chosen one.

303
00:17:49,850 --> 00:17:51,220
What’s the chosen one?

304
00:17:51,250 --> 00:17:53,390
Yotha wants to get to know you.

305
00:17:54,730 --> 00:17:55,160
Me?

306
00:17:55,180 --> 00:17:55,920
Yeah.

307
00:17:56,140 --> 00:17:57,900
Doesn’t he know me already?

308
00:17:58,400 --> 00:17:59,500
I mean,

309
00:18:00,090 --> 00:18:02,320
get to know you better.

310
00:18:22,120 --> 00:18:23,600
Is he not coming back tonight?

311
00:18:33,480 --> 00:18:35,880
Why does the power have to go out when I’m alone?

312
00:18:55,790 --> 00:18:56,690
What are you doing?

313
00:18:56,990 --> 00:18:58,620
Oh, I’m spying on…

314
00:18:59,120 --> 00:19:01,020
Oops, Fai.

315
00:19:01,040 --> 00:19:02,170
What are you doing here?

316
00:19:02,350 --> 00:19:03,320
Do I look handsome in my photos?

317
00:19:04,650 --> 00:19:05,610
So-so.

318
00:19:06,520 --> 00:19:07,610
Please.

319
00:19:07,640 --> 00:19:11,070
I know you’re not stalking my IG
because you want to see my photos.

320
00:19:11,340 --> 00:19:14,620
If you want to ask something, just ask.

321
00:19:19,880 --> 00:19:21,360
I want to ask about Yotha.

322
00:19:23,640 --> 00:19:28,330
People around me say he’s scary

323
00:19:28,760 --> 00:19:30,330
but that’s not what I’ve seen.

324
00:19:30,540 --> 00:19:32,600
It’s half true.

325
00:19:34,200 --> 00:19:36,710
When you see him acting harmless,

326
00:19:36,730 --> 00:19:38,290
that’s really who he is.

327
00:19:38,830 --> 00:19:40,320
He just doesn’t show that side to anyone

328
00:19:40,350 --> 00:19:41,670
except the people he’s close to.

329
00:19:41,700 --> 00:19:44,510
As for what happens at the bar, that’s also true.

330
00:19:45,350 --> 00:19:47,210
What happens at the bar?

331
00:19:48,210 --> 00:19:51,070
You know my parents divorced, right?

332
00:19:51,680 --> 00:19:54,640
Yotha also went through something else that hurt him

333
00:19:54,670 --> 00:19:57,870
so he believes love always ends in a breakup.

334
00:19:57,880 --> 00:19:58,420
Huh?

335
00:19:58,460 --> 00:19:59,200
Yeah.

336
00:20:04,780 --> 00:20:06,060
Are you here alone?

337
00:20:08,440 --> 00:20:11,090
Sorry, I don’t talk to anyone who’s taken.

338
00:20:11,890 --> 00:20:13,340
I won’t be anyone’s option.

339
00:20:16,540 --> 00:20:18,050
What if I say

340
00:20:18,700 --> 00:20:20,220
I want to talk to you only?

341
00:20:22,150 --> 00:20:23,350
Prove it.

342
00:20:25,110 --> 00:20:26,990
Once those girls break up with their partners,

343
00:20:27,020 --> 00:20:28,460
Yotha ghosts them.

344
00:20:28,490 --> 00:20:29,270
What?

345
00:20:29,920 --> 00:20:31,420
Why would he do that?

346
00:20:32,120 --> 00:20:34,400
He said if people really love each other,

347
00:20:34,430 --> 00:20:36,090
they won’t look at anyone else.

348
00:20:36,110 --> 00:20:39,100
He does that to shorten the relationships

349
00:20:39,120 --> 00:20:40,340
and save people’s time.

350
00:20:40,630 --> 00:20:41,710
Is that allowed?

351
00:20:44,070 --> 00:20:45,710
Why would he do that?

352
00:20:46,220 --> 00:20:47,120
I’m leaving.

353
00:20:47,720 --> 00:20:49,310
Where are you going?

354
00:20:49,330 --> 00:20:51,730
The real dog owner is here.

355
00:20:51,760 --> 00:20:53,800
I’m just the sitter.

356
00:20:53,820 --> 00:20:54,810
I’m heading out now.

357
00:20:54,840 --> 00:20:55,480
See you.

358
00:20:56,750 --> 00:20:57,540
Bye.

359
00:21:20,750 --> 00:21:22,370
The power at the dorm will be out until 5 a.m.

360
00:21:25,320 --> 00:21:26,000
Mm.

361
00:21:28,180 --> 00:21:29,390
If it’s not too hot for you,

362
00:21:29,410 --> 00:21:31,340
you can go back to the room and sleep.

363
00:21:31,340 --> 00:21:32,530
I’ll be fine alone.

364
00:21:40,190 --> 00:21:40,990
I’m sleepy.

365
00:21:43,600 --> 00:21:44,550
I’ll sleep now.

366
00:22:04,910 --> 00:22:05,880
What are you doing?

367
00:22:14,880 --> 00:22:17,540
I know where you disappear to late at night.

368
00:22:18,610 --> 00:22:20,650
I wanted to ask you why you did it

369
00:22:21,480 --> 00:22:23,390
but Faifa already gave me the answer.

370
00:22:23,690 --> 00:22:25,200
How do you feel now that you know?

371
00:22:34,660 --> 00:22:35,890
I don’t know.

372
00:22:38,040 --> 00:22:39,850
I think I both understand

373
00:22:40,600 --> 00:22:41,880
and don’t at the same time.

374
00:22:42,530 --> 00:22:43,610
Understand?

375
00:22:45,220 --> 00:22:50,520
Have you slept with anyone?

376
00:22:51,400 --> 00:22:54,970
I mean, have you ever had feelings for anyone
or something like that?

377
00:22:54,990 --> 00:22:56,410
I’ve never slept with anyone.

378
00:23:02,110 --> 00:23:05,900
Have you really loved anyone?

379
00:23:07,580 --> 00:23:08,800
Go to sleep, Beagle.

380
00:23:10,870 --> 00:23:11,640
Alright.

381
00:23:42,820 --> 00:23:44,590
Why did you let Faifa tell me?

382
00:23:55,080 --> 00:23:56,350
Because I want to know

383
00:23:57,520 --> 00:23:59,890
if you can accept me for who I am.

384
00:24:07,650 --> 00:24:12,240
If I disappoint you, I’m sorry, Beagle.

385
00:24:18,150 --> 00:24:19,870
Don’t have nightmares, Yotha.

386
00:24:20,500 --> 00:24:25,810
♪ No worries, give me a chance to try ♪

387
00:24:25,840 --> 00:24:29,450
♪ I’ll open up your heart to a new light inside ♪

388
00:24:29,480 --> 00:24:35,840
♪ True love is real, though you’re not into ♪

389
00:24:35,870 --> 00:24:39,880
♪ I’m reaching for you, believe me, won’t you? ♪

390
00:24:53,430 --> 00:24:54,810
Have you been here all night?

391
00:25:01,620 --> 00:25:02,990
You didn’t move at all?

392
00:25:03,810 --> 00:25:04,600
Mm.

393
00:25:07,680 --> 00:25:12,100
Not even to go to the restroom or buy snacks?

394
00:25:12,760 --> 00:25:14,760
You really are only quiet when you sleep.

395
00:25:17,600 --> 00:25:18,760
You’re scolding me again.

396
00:25:20,940 --> 00:25:22,090
Get up. Let’s go get something to eat.

397
00:25:24,910 --> 00:25:26,710
Am I hearing things?

398
00:25:27,290 --> 00:25:29,200
You’re asking me out to eat?

399
00:25:29,550 --> 00:25:30,540
Get up.

400
00:25:31,690 --> 00:25:32,960
Let’s go.

401
00:25:34,720 --> 00:25:36,800
I’ll wash this and give it back later.

402
00:25:37,200 --> 00:25:38,350
Do whatever you want.

403
00:25:46,950 --> 00:25:48,200
Hey. Wait up.

404
00:25:50,920 --> 00:25:52,130
What can I get for you?

405
00:25:52,160 --> 00:25:54,460
Can I get pork congee with everything?

406
00:25:54,490 --> 00:25:55,470
Make it special.

407
00:25:55,500 --> 00:25:56,110
Sure.

408
00:25:56,600 --> 00:25:57,200
And you?

409
00:25:57,880 --> 00:25:59,090
I’ll get the same thing as you.

410
00:25:59,120 --> 00:25:59,900
Special, right?

411
00:25:59,920 --> 00:26:00,510
Mm.

412
00:26:01,120 --> 00:26:02,480
I mean me.

413
00:26:02,500 --> 00:26:03,550
Am I special?

414
00:26:07,460 --> 00:26:08,170
Mm.

415
00:26:11,130 --> 00:26:12,570
Two pork congees. Make it special.

416
00:26:12,990 --> 00:26:14,820
This table’s very special.

417
00:26:15,570 --> 00:26:16,190
It’s hot.

418
00:26:17,160 --> 00:26:17,890
Why is it so hot?

419
00:26:20,360 --> 00:26:20,990
Chili.

420
00:26:42,840 --> 00:26:43,650
Yotha.

421
00:26:44,010 --> 00:26:44,570
Hmm?

422
00:26:45,270 --> 00:26:47,880
I just thought of another question.

423
00:26:48,640 --> 00:26:49,720
Try and ask.

424
00:26:50,350 --> 00:26:51,900
I’ll see if I’ll answer.

425
00:26:52,320 --> 00:26:55,770
When you’re at uni, you seem bad at socializing

426
00:26:55,800 --> 00:26:57,020
and you don’t really talk to anyone.

427
00:26:57,050 --> 00:26:58,880
When you’re at the bar

428
00:26:58,900 --> 00:27:01,380
and want to talk to someone, how do you do it?

429
00:27:01,660 --> 00:27:02,710
Why do you want to know?

430
00:27:03,240 --> 00:27:07,820
I just want to get to know another side of you, that’s all.

431
00:27:07,850 --> 00:27:10,240
But if you’re not comfortable answering, it’s fine.

432
00:27:10,280 --> 00:27:11,120
Hi.

433
00:27:11,900 --> 00:27:12,440
This seat is not taken.

434
00:27:12,460 --> 00:27:13,270
Feel free to join me.

435
00:27:14,780 --> 00:27:15,240
Huh?

436
00:27:16,410 --> 00:27:17,550
Who did you come here with?

437
00:27:18,090 --> 00:27:18,950
Are you dating anyone?

438
00:27:24,310 --> 00:27:27,580
I came with my partner

439
00:27:28,830 --> 00:27:30,100
but

440
00:27:31,310 --> 00:27:32,690
I want your number.

441
00:27:33,510 --> 00:27:34,780
Break up with your partner

442
00:27:35,440 --> 00:27:36,820
and I’ll give you my number.

443
00:27:37,610 --> 00:27:38,700
I lied.

444
00:27:38,930 --> 00:27:40,390
I’m not seeing anyone.

445
00:27:45,540 --> 00:27:46,360
What are you doing?

446
00:27:48,280 --> 00:27:49,890
I wasn’t really asking for your number.

447
00:27:50,560 --> 00:27:51,380
I want you to have it.

448
00:27:51,400 --> 00:27:52,500
Oh.

449
00:27:52,920 --> 00:27:54,500
Now that you’ve given me your number,

450
00:27:54,520 --> 00:27:56,780
when I reach out, you’ll ghost me, right?

451
00:27:57,050 --> 00:27:57,690
Why?

452
00:27:58,050 --> 00:27:59,790
Fai told me that

453
00:28:00,670 --> 00:28:02,670
when you break them up,

454
00:28:03,230 --> 00:28:06,710
you give them your number and then ghost them.

455
00:28:08,360 --> 00:28:11,900
I never gave them the number I gave you.

456
00:28:13,160 --> 00:28:14,280
What do you mean?

457
00:28:14,740 --> 00:28:16,380
If I wanted to cut contact,

458
00:28:16,800 --> 00:28:18,570
I wouldn’t be dumb enough to give my real number.

459
00:28:18,590 --> 00:28:19,660
Whoa.

460
00:28:20,030 --> 00:28:23,470
You not only lie to them but give them a fake number too?

461
00:28:24,060 --> 00:28:25,450
You’re so mean.

462
00:28:25,480 --> 00:28:26,780
I don’t want to talk to them.

463
00:28:27,670 --> 00:28:29,670
Then why did you give me your number?

464
00:28:34,080 --> 00:28:35,500
Why is it so hard for you to understand?

465
00:28:37,130 --> 00:28:38,240
I want to talk to you.

466
00:28:45,060 --> 00:28:50,350
Can I really call you?

467
00:28:51,820 --> 00:28:53,480
If you have something important, call me.

468
00:28:55,720 --> 00:28:57,370
What if it’s not important?

469
00:28:57,690 --> 00:28:58,570
Can I still call you?

470
00:28:58,920 --> 00:29:01,000
If it’s not important, wait until we’re in our room.

471
00:29:04,760 --> 00:29:06,430
Okay. As you said.

472
00:29:12,830 --> 00:29:13,680
Why are you staring at me?

473
00:29:14,190 --> 00:29:14,960
Keep eating.

474
00:29:40,510 --> 00:29:43,390
They want us to wear the jacket in the second semester.

475
00:29:43,410 --> 00:29:44,090
Have you heard?

476
00:29:44,940 --> 00:29:46,940
Soon, you won’t need me to tie this for you anymore.

477
00:29:48,940 --> 00:29:49,680
Why?

478
00:29:50,830 --> 00:29:52,550
When we start wearing the jacket,

479
00:29:52,580 --> 00:29:54,410
we won’t have to follow the uniform rules anymore.

480
00:29:55,280 --> 00:29:56,490
I don’t like wearing that jacket.

481
00:29:59,390 --> 00:30:00,480
Are you crazy?

482
00:30:01,390 --> 00:30:02,920
Everyone wants to wear the jacket

483
00:30:03,470 --> 00:30:04,860
because it’s cool.

484
00:30:06,980 --> 00:30:08,410
I look cool in everything.

485
00:30:11,070 --> 00:30:12,410
Sure.

486
00:30:17,800 --> 00:30:23,210

487

488
00:30:26,370 --> 00:30:27,300

489
00:30:27,900 --> 00:30:28,830
Ouch!

490
00:30:29,310 --> 00:30:32,100

491

492
00:30:40,810 --> 00:30:42,250
Pay attention in class, Beagle.

493
00:31:08,140 --> 00:31:10,300
What’s wrong with you two?

494
00:31:10,320 --> 00:31:11,660
I was fine at first.

495
00:31:11,690 --> 00:31:12,720
What about now?

496
00:31:13,000 --> 00:31:13,900
My waist is twisted.

497
00:31:13,920 --> 00:31:15,070
How?

498
00:31:15,100 --> 00:31:15,880
Like this.

499
00:31:17,880 --> 00:31:20,380
If I touch someone, their waist will twist too.

500
00:31:20,400 --> 00:31:21,120
Hey!

501
00:31:24,430 --> 00:31:25,640
Are you crazy?

502
00:31:25,670 --> 00:31:29,870
Who touches someone
and twists their waist?

503
00:31:36,300 --> 00:31:39,360
Well done, my little Beagle.

504
00:31:41,360 --> 00:31:42,550
What’s his name?

505
00:31:42,570 --> 00:31:44,550
His name is Beagle.

506
00:31:44,720 --> 00:31:45,940
I love dogs.

507
00:31:45,950 --> 00:31:46,640
Beagle.

508
00:31:47,360 --> 00:31:48,030
Beagle.

509
00:31:48,040 --> 00:31:48,620
Hey!

510
00:31:48,650 --> 00:31:54,380
Don’t!

511
00:31:54,410 --> 00:31:55,080
Beagle!

512
00:31:56,110 --> 00:31:56,960
Beagle!

513
00:31:56,990 --> 00:31:58,010
Beagle!

514
00:32:04,170 --> 00:32:05,560
Why don’t you go have a closer look?

515
00:32:05,590 --> 00:32:07,400
You can’t see anything from here.

516
00:32:08,160 --> 00:32:09,380
I’m not watching them.

517
00:32:10,480 --> 00:32:12,480
I’m just waiting to perform with the next group.

518
00:32:13,260 --> 00:32:15,150
Okay, I misunderstood.

519
00:32:15,180 --> 00:32:16,260
Sorry, big bro.

520
00:32:30,670 --> 00:32:33,890
Yay!

521
00:32:41,440 --> 00:32:44,520
Next group, please.

522
00:33:00,620 --> 00:33:02,520
My friends sent me to make you scream.

523
00:33:13,458 --> 00:33:14,252
Thank you.

524
00:33:21,850 --> 00:33:22,923
What was that?

525
00:33:23,290 --> 00:33:25,895
He said his friends wanted him
to give an intro speech to make people scream.

526
00:33:26,369 --> 00:33:28,360
I thought he’d say more than that.

527
00:33:28,540 --> 00:33:30,430
Yotha was only on stage for a moment

528
00:33:30,529 --> 00:33:33,181
but people screamed for him
more than when Ears was trying to act like a cute dog.

529
00:33:33,212 --> 00:33:34,861
That’s a good one.

530
00:33:36,360 --> 00:33:37,907
Cute dog.

531
00:33:38,843 --> 00:33:39,900
The dog will bite you.

532
00:33:40,490 --> 00:33:41,415
I’ve been vaccinated.

533
00:33:42,363 --> 00:33:44,338
Yotha is so Yotha.

534
00:33:48,940 --> 00:33:51,286
That’s a wrap for today’s activity.

535
00:33:51,304 --> 00:33:52,344
You all did a great job.

536
00:33:52,363 --> 00:33:54,867
Let’s give yourselves a big hand.

537
00:33:59,740 --> 00:34:01,052
Before you go, just one announcement.

538
00:34:01,070 --> 00:34:03,310
Tomorrow, we’ll be having a special activity

539
00:34:03,329 --> 00:34:06,990
for the first time this year: Buddy Draw.

540
00:34:07,390 --> 00:34:10,861
Please make sure to join.

541
00:34:11,130 --> 00:34:14,996
Lastly, Civil Engineering is the only major
that hasn’t sent a representative for the star contest.

542
00:34:15,015 --> 00:34:16,486
Please give us a name by tomorrow.

543
00:34:16,523 --> 00:34:18,480
That’s all for today.

544
00:34:25,840 --> 00:34:27,563
Has anyone seen Yotha?

545
00:34:28,240 --> 00:34:29,526
Let’s ask someone else.

546
00:34:29,556 --> 00:34:30,916
He won’t do it.

547
00:34:31,820 --> 00:34:33,421
You talked to him the other day, right?

548
00:34:35,300 --> 00:34:36,916
Guys, I’m leaving.

549
00:34:37,770 --> 00:34:38,670
See you.

550
00:34:52,250 --> 00:34:53,883
I knew you’d be here.

551
00:34:55,770 --> 00:34:56,541
What’s the matter?

552
00:34:57,380 --> 00:34:59,501
The whole Civil Engineering major is looking for you.

553
00:34:59,830 --> 00:35:00,707
I know.

554
00:35:01,400 --> 00:35:02,529
That’s why I’m here.

555
00:35:02,763 --> 00:35:03,864
Why?

556
00:35:04,760 --> 00:35:06,436
Why won’t you agree to be your major’s rep?

557
00:35:06,449 --> 00:35:07,864
They still need to decide

558
00:35:07,889 --> 00:35:09,673
who they want as the faculty rep anyway.

559
00:35:09,981 --> 00:35:11,323
How do you know

560
00:35:11,353 --> 00:35:13,320
they won’t choose me to be the faculty rep?

561
00:35:14,140 --> 00:35:15,870
Come on, Yotha.

562
00:35:16,295 --> 00:35:17,920
There are so many people more handsome than you.

563
00:35:18,730 --> 00:35:21,821
Besides, I don’t think you fit

564
00:35:22,400 --> 00:35:25,384
the Perfect 10 concept this year

565
00:35:27,620 --> 00:35:32,744
because you lack interpersonal skills.

566
00:35:34,824 --> 00:35:35,796
I still won’t do it.

567
00:35:36,950 --> 00:35:39,169
I don’t like anything chaotic.

568
00:35:39,187 --> 00:35:40,196
Are you picking on me?

569
00:35:40,221 --> 00:35:41,052
What do you mean?

570
00:35:41,076 --> 00:35:44,338
You once said
I’m the troublemaker in Engineering.

571
00:35:44,350 --> 00:35:46,012
That means you don’t like me.

572
00:35:46,498 --> 00:35:47,415
You’re the exception.

573
00:35:58,780 --> 00:35:59,895
Let’s check inside.

574
00:35:59,920 --> 00:36:01,064
- Maybe Yotha is here.
- 	Hey!

575
00:36:01,420 --> 00:36:02,781
What’s going on?

576
00:36:03,058 --> 00:36:05,267
Yotha, what are you doing?

577
00:36:07,753 --> 00:36:09,260
What’s going on?

578
00:36:12,270 --> 00:36:13,132
He’s not here.

579
00:36:13,150 --> 00:36:15,130
Let’s go. This is the men's restroom.

580
00:36:44,290 --> 00:36:45,200
What are you doing?

581
00:36:55,200 --> 00:36:56,412
You really look like a beagle.

582
00:37:00,720 --> 00:37:05,384
♪ It’s you, only you, who teaches me love ♪

583
00:37:05,403 --> 00:37:11,729
♪ It’s you, only you, who makes me see ♪

584
00:37:11,753 --> 00:37:14,172
♪ What true love is like  ♪

585
00:37:23,850 --> 00:37:25,304
You really won’t take it off, huh?

586
00:37:30,810 --> 00:37:32,510
But you look cute wearing it.

587
00:37:32,529 --> 00:37:33,230
I like it.

588
00:37:37,130 --> 00:37:40,233
Are you going straight back to the dorm?

589
00:37:42,230 --> 00:37:43,261
Probably not.

590
00:37:43,920 --> 00:37:45,489
Are you going to the bar again?

591
00:37:45,990 --> 00:37:46,750
Mm.

592
00:37:48,250 --> 00:37:50,695
Drive safe, then.

593
00:37:51,550 --> 00:37:52,473
Aeagle.

594
00:37:53,330 --> 00:37:54,301
It’s Beagle.

595
00:37:54,770 --> 00:37:56,135
You said it correctly earlier.

596
00:37:57,950 --> 00:37:58,941
Wanna come with me?

597
00:38:01,200 --> 00:38:02,596
Can I?

598
00:38:03,320 --> 00:38:03,926
Mm.

599
00:38:04,184 --> 00:38:05,150
If you want to.

600
00:38:23,304 --> 00:38:24,043
Are you afraid?

601
00:38:29,790 --> 00:38:30,289
Come on.

602
00:38:35,569 --> 00:38:37,560
Why do I have to wear this?

603
00:38:38,800 --> 00:38:40,332
Because the bar is open.

604
00:38:40,356 --> 00:38:43,132
It’s not appropriate to enter in a student uniform.

605
00:38:55,560 --> 00:39:00,584
Are you sure I can go in?

606
00:39:05,600 --> 00:39:08,640
You can if you want to.

607
00:39:12,170 --> 00:39:13,366
But you can still change your mind.

608
00:39:18,180 --> 00:39:18,990
I won’t.

609
00:39:34,830 --> 00:39:36,018
Sorry.

610
00:39:36,387 --> 00:39:37,378
Sorry.

611
00:39:39,170 --> 00:39:40,363
Walk in front of me.

612
00:39:41,450 --> 00:39:43,175
But I don’t know the way.

613
00:39:47,803 --> 00:39:51,760
♪ But hear this plea of mine ♪

614
00:39:51,796 --> 00:39:55,058

615
00:39:55,083 --> 00:39:58,153

00:39:58,184 --> 00:39:59,200

♪ Trust me, it won’t be repeated history ♪

621
00:40:17,080 --> 00:40:19,080
I didn’t expect the bar to have this room upstairs.

622
00:40:20,060 --> 00:40:21,120
Make yourself at home.

623
00:40:26,820 --> 00:40:29,784
Is this like your home?

624
00:40:30,060 --> 00:40:30,953
No.

625
00:40:31,560 --> 00:40:33,206
It's just where I sleep.

626
00:40:34,646 --> 00:40:36,640
Where’s Faifa’s room?

627
00:40:39,210 --> 00:40:40,024
He doesn’t have one.

628
00:40:41,190 --> 00:40:43,003
He probably doesn’t like anything like this.

629
00:40:43,415 --> 00:40:46,461
Besides, he prefers being at home to keep Dad company.

630
00:40:47,950 --> 00:40:48,726
Wow.

631
00:40:48,953 --> 00:40:50,203
Such a good boy.

632
00:40:50,584 --> 00:40:52,406
Just keeping Dad company makes him a good boy?

633
00:41:02,707 --> 00:41:05,421
This bar is owned by my older brother Newton

634
00:41:05,446 --> 00:41:06,984
and two other partners.

635
00:41:09,250 --> 00:41:10,406
Uh-huh.

636
00:41:10,443 --> 00:41:10,953
Mm.

637
00:41:14,898 --> 00:41:16,412
Do you want to know anything else?

638
00:41:21,316 --> 00:41:23,310
I want to know

639
00:41:23,900 --> 00:41:29,292
if we’re staying here tonight.

640
00:41:32,190 --> 00:41:33,212
That’s up to you.

641
00:41:35,000 --> 00:41:39,255
Are you going downstairs to do your thing?

642
00:41:41,920 --> 00:41:42,898
Probably not tonight.

643
00:41:44,110 --> 00:41:44,830
Why not?

644
00:41:45,740 --> 00:41:46,738
I’m keeping you company.

645
00:41:48,570 --> 00:41:50,110
Am I bothering you?

646
00:41:50,153 --> 00:41:51,673
If I am, I can leave.

647
00:41:51,698 --> 00:41:52,523
Hey.

648
00:41:53,520 --> 00:41:54,227
Sit down.

649
00:41:56,800 --> 00:41:57,796
No.

650
00:41:59,090 --> 00:42:01,889
Then why are you keeping me company?

651
00:42:04,049 --> 00:42:05,624
I just want to be a good boy for a change.

652
00:42:07,160 --> 00:42:07,907
Here I am,

653
00:42:08,240 --> 00:42:09,900
keeping you company.

654
00:42:09,920 --> 00:42:10,910
Am I a good boy now?

655
00:42:23,660 --> 00:42:25,901
Answer my question.

656
00:42:26,560 --> 00:42:27,889
Am I a good boy now?

657
00:42:32,984 --> 00:42:34,166
I don’t know.

658
00:42:44,120 --> 00:42:45,298
Sorry.

659
00:42:45,341 --> 00:42:46,332
Are you okay?

660
00:42:46,910 --> 00:42:48,504
Oh, hi.

661
00:42:49,640 --> 00:42:50,738
Do we know each other?

662
00:42:50,756 --> 00:42:51,501
Oh.

663
00:42:54,220 --> 00:42:55,015
No, we don’t.

664
00:42:56,610 --> 00:42:57,593
Are you okay?

665
00:42:57,907 --> 00:42:58,775
- I’m sorry.
- 	Hey.

666
00:42:58,806 --> 00:43:00,080
You’re going to get messy too.

667
00:43:06,030 --> 00:43:07,046
Come here.

668
00:43:07,304 --> 00:43:07,747
Come on.

669
00:43:07,760 --> 00:43:08,861
What are you doing?

670
00:43:10,260 --> 00:43:11,163
Wait here.

671
00:43:11,187 --> 00:43:12,443
I’ll be right back, okay?

672
00:43:12,470 --> 00:43:13,046
- Don’t go anywhere.
- But…

673
00:43:13,076 --> 00:43:13,790
Don’t move.

674
00:43:13,815 --> 00:43:15,501
Wait here. Don’t go anywhere.

675
00:43:23,990 --> 00:43:24,886
So?

676
00:43:26,010 --> 00:43:27,390
I’m asking if I’m a good boy now.

677
00:43:27,680 --> 00:43:28,689
I don’t know.

678
00:43:28,713 --> 00:43:29,366
Tell me.

679
00:43:41,895 --> 00:43:42,953
Yotha.

680
00:43:43,686 --> 00:43:45,360
Yotha, you brat!

681
00:43:53,880 --> 00:43:54,609
What do you want?

682
00:43:54,836 --> 00:43:56,092
I just went downstairs

683
00:43:56,610 --> 00:43:58,307
and someone said you brought a guy to your room.

684
00:43:58,830 --> 00:44:00,166
Nonsense.

685
00:44:00,196 --> 00:44:01,027
He’s my friend from the faculty.

686
00:44:01,040 --> 00:44:01,729
You’re lying.

687
00:44:01,741 --> 00:44:02,787
I’m not.

688
00:44:02,818 --> 00:44:03,772
You’re acting weird.

689
00:44:03,796 --> 00:44:04,584
No.

690
00:44:04,615 --> 00:44:05,446
Let me see him.

691
00:44:05,464 --> 00:44:06,510
New!

692
00:44:10,892 --> 00:44:12,123
Newton!

693
00:44:15,390 --> 00:44:16,584
Hi.

694
00:44:17,052 --> 00:44:18,769
I’m Yotha’s roommate.

695
00:44:21,460 --> 00:44:23,058
No wonder you brought him to this room.

696
00:44:23,070 --> 00:44:23,710
New!

697
00:44:23,735 --> 00:44:24,283
Shut up!

698
00:44:26,246 --> 00:44:27,113
Come on.

699
00:44:27,427 --> 00:44:28,953
Don’t be shy.

700
00:44:43,907 --> 00:44:45,003
He’s just your type.

701
00:44:47,384 --> 00:44:48,418
Get out.

702
00:45:01,430 --> 00:45:02,393
I’m back.

703
00:45:06,584 --> 00:45:09,581
Here’s a T-shirt

704
00:45:09,618 --> 00:45:10,775
for you to change into if you’re feeling sticky.

705
00:45:10,793 --> 00:45:11,187
Okay.

706
00:45:11,212 --> 00:45:12,110
I got you wet wipes,

707
00:45:12,135 --> 00:45:12,935
dry tissues—

708
00:45:12,966 --> 00:45:13,944
Are your socks dirty?

709
00:45:13,981 --> 00:45:14,898
I got you a new pair.

710
00:45:14,916 --> 00:45:15,901
Hold on.

711
00:45:15,938 --> 00:45:17,390
I was going to get you new shoes too,

712
00:45:17,421 --> 00:45:18,240
but they didn’t have any.

713
00:45:18,258 --> 00:45:20,104
Hey, it’s not a big deal.

714
00:45:20,313 --> 00:45:21,003
It is a big deal.

715
00:45:21,021 --> 00:45:23,292
Oh, and I wasn’t sure how sweet you like your drinks.

716
00:45:23,323 --> 00:45:24,473
These are no sugar and 50% sweet.

717
00:45:24,492 --> 00:45:26,043
These are 75% and 100% sweet.

718
00:45:27,830 --> 00:45:30,190
Where do you live?

719
00:45:30,880 --> 00:45:31,926
Do you need a ride?

720
00:45:31,944 --> 00:45:33,187
I want to make it up to you.

721
00:45:35,750 --> 00:45:38,387
I stopped being mad at you
when you said sorry the first time.

722
00:45:38,412 --> 00:45:39,076
Really?

723
00:45:39,880 --> 00:45:40,793
You’re so cute.

724
00:45:44,020 --> 00:45:47,507
It’s late. Why are you still outside?

725
00:45:47,930 --> 00:45:49,015
What are you doing here?

726
00:45:49,600 --> 00:45:52,160
I came for the uni tutoring course,

727
00:45:52,603 --> 00:45:53,907
but I was on my way home.

728
00:45:54,820 --> 00:45:55,649
What faculty?

729
00:45:56,006 --> 00:45:56,916
Engineering.

730
00:45:57,710 --> 00:45:58,880
That’s my faculty.

731
00:45:58,910 --> 00:46:01,495
So this means you’re going to be my junior, right?

732
00:46:01,532 --> 00:46:02,520
You better watch out.

733
00:46:02,547 --> 00:46:04,520
I’ll see you in the junior welcoming activities.

734
00:46:04,806 --> 00:46:06,520
Let me get in first,

735
00:46:06,553 --> 00:46:08,520
then you can think about how to welcome me.

736
00:46:10,215 --> 00:46:12,210
You know there’s a belief here.

737
00:46:12,780 --> 00:46:13,729
A belief?

738
00:46:14,620 --> 00:46:16,720
They said if you trip and fall here,

739
00:46:16,763 --> 00:46:19,255
you’ll get accepted to the faculty.

740
00:46:19,286 --> 00:46:20,030
Really?

741
00:46:20,061 --> 00:46:20,763
Yeah.

742
00:46:21,620 --> 00:46:24,461
I’ve only heard that

743
00:46:24,861 --> 00:46:26,860
if you trip in the engineering courtyard,

744
00:46:26,892 --> 00:46:28,190
you’ll get a partner from Engineering.

745
00:46:28,227 --> 00:46:29,076
Really?

746
00:46:30,240 --> 00:46:31,132
What a bummer.

747
00:46:31,581 --> 00:46:33,130
I wished this was the courtyard.

748
00:46:33,163 --> 00:46:34,024
What?

749
00:46:34,270 --> 00:46:36,110
Oh, nothing.

750
00:46:39,990 --> 00:46:40,812
Hi, Mom.

751
00:46:42,200 --> 00:46:43,292
I’m walking there.

752
00:46:49,630 --> 00:46:50,763
My mom is here.

753
00:46:50,960 --> 00:46:51,926
I should go.

754
00:46:51,950 --> 00:46:52,627
Okay.

755
00:46:54,100 --> 00:46:56,812
Are you really giving me all this?

756
00:46:57,150 --> 00:46:57,901
1,200 baht.

757
00:47:00,440 --> 00:47:01,476
Just kidding.

758
00:47:01,501 --> 00:47:02,990
You can take everything.

759
00:47:11,260 --> 00:47:12,227
Safe trip home.

760
00:47:15,300 --> 00:47:16,627
See you soon, Junior.

761
00:47:24,380 --> 00:47:25,360
He’s so cute.

762
00:47:36,818 --> 00:47:38,086
- Do you want to watch a movie?
- 	What should we do?

763
00:47:39,600 --> 00:47:40,295
Sure.

764
00:47:40,780 --> 00:47:41,729
Which one?

765
00:47:43,080 --> 00:47:44,086
Up to you.

766
00:47:44,470 --> 00:47:45,883
What kind of movies do you like?

767
00:47:55,760 --> 00:47:58,713
When the bar closes, I’ll take you downstairs.

768
00:48:00,080 --> 00:48:00,603
Huh?

769
00:48:00,861 --> 00:48:01,612
Me?

770
00:48:02,350 --> 00:48:03,606
Why are you taking me downstairs?

771
00:48:06,920 --> 00:48:07,526
Oh.

772
00:48:13,580 --> 00:48:14,424
Mom.

773
00:48:14,603 --> 00:48:15,593
Hey, Gun.

774
00:48:15,860 --> 00:48:17,366
You’re not back at your dorm?

775
00:48:17,730 --> 00:48:18,972
Not yet, Mom.

776
00:48:19,003 --> 00:48:20,670
I’m…

777
00:48:21,780 --> 00:48:24,658
I’m helping my friend…

778
00:48:24,916 --> 00:48:26,067
with his assignment.

779
00:48:26,092 --> 00:48:26,996
Huh?

780
00:48:29,020 --> 00:48:30,424
(Go get your assignment.)

781
00:48:30,455 --> 00:48:31,249
(Hurry.)

782
00:48:31,273 --> 00:48:31,760
What?

783
00:48:31,790 --> 00:48:32,689
Speak clearly.

784
00:48:32,707 --> 00:48:34,680
(Go grab some sheets.)

785
00:48:37,230 --> 00:48:38,498
Just a moment, Mom.

786
00:48:41,298 --> 00:48:41,858
(Hurry!)

787
00:48:41,870 --> 00:48:42,490
(Hurry!)

788
00:48:44,740 --> 00:48:46,855
We just went to get the assignment.

789
00:48:46,873 --> 00:48:49,329
This is my friend Yotha.

790
00:48:49,532 --> 00:48:50,516
Hi.

791
00:48:51,040 --> 00:48:52,806
Are you Nong Gun’s new friend?

792
00:48:56,904 --> 00:48:58,646
Tell me what you’re hiding.

793
00:48:58,670 --> 00:48:59,403
Huh?

794
00:48:59,920 --> 00:49:00,867
Nothing.

795
00:49:01,580 --> 00:49:05,563
Why are you asking this?

796
00:49:05,587 --> 00:49:08,387
Because you’re not calling yourself
what you usually do.

797
00:49:08,412 --> 00:49:10,276
I’m with my friend.

798
00:49:10,940 --> 00:49:11,870
Nong Gun.

799
00:49:16,630 --> 00:49:19,821
No, Noo’s not hiding anything.

800
00:49:19,846 --> 00:49:20,473
Noo?

801
00:49:21,020 --> 00:49:22,332
Why are you laughing?

802
00:49:22,480 --> 00:49:25,680
Nong Gun,
don’t be rude to your friend.

803
00:49:25,809 --> 00:49:27,175
Mom!

804
00:49:27,212 --> 00:49:28,800
I won’t take up any more of your time.

805
00:49:28,836 --> 00:49:32,436
Text me when you get back to your dorm.

806
00:49:32,461 --> 00:49:33,575
I will.

807
00:49:33,910 --> 00:49:35,033
Bye-bye.

808
00:49:41,640 --> 00:49:42,738
Why are you looking at me?

809
00:49:43,273 --> 00:49:44,730
Is that how you usually talk to your mom?

810
00:49:45,090 --> 00:49:46,904
Yeah, why?

811
00:49:48,310 --> 00:49:49,058
Nothing.

812
00:49:50,060 --> 00:49:51,052
Is something wrong?

813
00:49:51,930 --> 00:49:53,273
You seem close to your mom.

814
00:49:53,710 --> 00:49:55,366
I’ve lived with her since I was born.

815
00:49:55,396 --> 00:49:56,646
Of course, I’m close to her.

816
00:49:57,000 --> 00:49:57,883
That’s a weird question.

817
00:49:58,480 --> 00:49:59,323
You’re right.

818
00:50:00,430 --> 00:50:02,116
I guess my family is the only weird one.

819
00:50:02,790 --> 00:50:07,341
Hey, I didn’t mean it like that.

820
00:50:09,464 --> 00:50:10,443
I’m sorry.

821
00:50:15,800 --> 00:50:16,738
Why are you apologizing?

822
00:50:17,550 --> 00:50:19,230
I shouldn’t have talked about it.

823
00:50:19,890 --> 00:50:21,193
But I want to hear it.

824
00:50:22,763 --> 00:50:23,396
Huh?

825
00:50:24,040 --> 00:50:25,310
As Fai said,

826
00:50:26,498 --> 00:50:28,490
I’ve been separated from my mom since I was young.

827
00:50:29,390 --> 00:50:30,590
Right now,

828
00:50:31,390 --> 00:50:33,021
I don’t remember what it felt like living with her.

829
00:50:33,267 --> 00:50:35,833
Are you okay?

830
00:50:36,220 --> 00:50:37,870
Just seeing you talk to your mom

831
00:50:41,870 --> 00:50:43,870
makes me happy too.

832
00:50:45,530 --> 00:50:46,400
Really?

833
00:50:46,430 --> 00:50:47,021
Mm.

834
00:50:47,880 --> 00:50:50,621
Then be my mom’s other son.

835
00:50:51,130 --> 00:50:51,895
What did you say?

836
00:50:53,000 --> 00:50:54,695
You can be my mom’s other son.

837
00:50:55,600 --> 00:50:57,698
My parents are very kind.

838
00:50:57,723 --> 00:50:59,329
So is my big sister.

839
00:50:59,341 --> 00:51:01,181
My mom is the best cook.

840
00:51:04,150 --> 00:51:05,323
Are you telling me this or bragging?

841
00:51:06,010 --> 00:51:06,713
Bragging.

842
00:51:09,120 --> 00:51:10,375
Come on.

843
00:51:10,730 --> 00:51:13,489
On the weekends I go home,

844
00:51:13,513 --> 00:51:15,003
do you want to come with me?

845
00:51:15,430 --> 00:51:16,252
Can I?

846
00:51:16,750 --> 00:51:17,507
Of course.

847
00:51:18,730 --> 00:51:20,320
If you come with me,

848
00:51:20,350 --> 00:51:23,889
my family will roll out the red carpet to welcome you.

849
00:51:24,380 --> 00:51:25,723
Why do you think so?

850
00:51:26,960 --> 00:51:30,012
Because I don’t really have friends.

851
00:51:30,440 --> 00:51:32,572
When I make new ones,

852
00:51:33,033 --> 00:51:35,030
my parents are really happy.

853
00:51:37,507 --> 00:51:38,812
Just kidding.

854
00:51:41,000 --> 00:51:43,200
I just want to share my home with you.

855
00:51:43,510 --> 00:51:47,304
I just want to find a way to make you smile more,

856
00:51:47,323 --> 00:51:50,984
without wearing Arm’s animal-printed yellow pajamas.

857
00:51:58,510 --> 00:52:00,596
Thank you, Beagle.

858
00:52:04,150 --> 00:52:06,276
You’re welcome, friend.

859
00:52:13,240 --> 00:52:14,289
Our business is doing well.

860
00:52:14,320 --> 00:52:15,329
I just hope we make this much money every day.

861
00:52:15,347 --> 00:52:16,190
Cheers.

862
00:52:23,650 --> 00:52:24,609
Hi, guys.

863
00:52:24,627 --> 00:52:25,236
Hi.

864
00:52:25,261 --> 00:52:26,209
Hi.

865
00:52:27,820 --> 00:52:28,615
Sit here.

866
00:52:31,530 --> 00:52:32,646
Are you Yotha’s friend?

867
00:52:33,050 --> 00:52:33,913
Oh, yes.

868
00:52:33,932 --> 00:52:35,910
My name is Gun. I’m his roommate.

869
00:52:36,440 --> 00:52:37,415
I’m Wa.

870
00:52:37,698 --> 00:52:38,701
That’s Nop.

871
00:52:39,000 --> 00:52:40,467
And that’s Newton,

872
00:52:40,486 --> 00:52:41,347
Yotha’s big brother.

873
00:52:41,360 --> 00:52:42,449
Hi.

874
00:52:42,547 --> 00:52:44,720
Yotha, you brought your friend here.

875
00:52:44,756 --> 00:52:46,356
You should take care of him.

876
00:52:46,381 --> 00:52:48,775
It’s not Wa’s job to introduce us.

877
00:52:50,030 --> 00:52:51,040
I didn’t really want to introduce you guys.

878
00:52:52,620 --> 00:52:55,230
Whoa, look how possessive you are.

879
00:52:56,210 --> 00:52:57,803
What would you like to drink, Gun?

880
00:52:57,827 --> 00:52:58,787
Let me get it for you.

881
00:52:58,972 --> 00:53:00,418
Well, I’d like…

882
00:53:00,443 --> 00:53:01,415
Just a cider.

883
00:53:06,930 --> 00:53:07,938
Isn’t that too light?

884
00:53:08,670 --> 00:53:09,310
No.

885
00:53:16,200 --> 00:53:17,403
A cider it is.

886
00:53:18,780 --> 00:53:19,790
What about you, Yotha?

887
00:53:19,821 --> 00:53:20,627
What do you want to drink?

888
00:53:23,310 --> 00:53:24,584
Just water. I drove here.

889
00:53:24,787 --> 00:53:25,427
Okay.

890
00:53:28,380 --> 00:53:31,501
So how’s sharing a room with Yotha?

891
00:53:31,910 --> 00:53:34,203
I bet it’s dead quiet.

892
00:53:34,690 --> 00:53:35,901
Not really, Nop.

893
00:53:37,580 --> 00:53:39,083
Sometimes, Yotha talks a lot.

894
00:53:39,390 --> 00:53:40,055
Huh?

895
00:53:41,440 --> 00:53:42,320
Really?

896
00:53:43,280 --> 00:53:44,775
Yotha talks a lot?

897
00:53:44,812 --> 00:53:46,129
Sometimes.

898
00:53:46,600 --> 00:53:48,184
Only when he’s in a good mood.

899
00:53:50,890 --> 00:53:52,209
Yotha in a good mood?

900
00:53:54,000 --> 00:53:55,889
I forgot what that’s like.

901
00:53:59,050 --> 00:54:01,107
Hey, what’s all this stress?

902
00:54:01,138 --> 00:54:02,024
Cheers!

903
00:54:02,040 --> 00:54:02,947
Come on.

904
00:54:02,972 --> 00:54:03,440
Yes.

905
00:54:03,470 --> 00:54:05,144
Count me in.

906
00:54:05,930 --> 00:54:06,960
Cheers!

907
00:54:17,450 --> 00:54:20,763
Gun, have you ever been scared
of anything in your life?

908
00:54:21,260 --> 00:54:22,449
Why do you ask?

909
00:54:22,473 --> 00:54:23,809
Because you’re unusual.

910
00:54:24,067 --> 00:54:25,563
How can you be around Yotha?

911
00:54:25,587 --> 00:54:26,535
Aren’t you scared of him?

912
00:54:29,230 --> 00:54:32,953
I’m scared of things in general.

913
00:54:32,984 --> 00:54:35,366
Like snakes, spiders,

914
00:54:35,396 --> 00:54:38,566
and animals with lots of legs.

915
00:54:39,020 --> 00:54:41,458
Oh, and I’m scared of sleeping with the lights off.

916
00:54:41,850 --> 00:54:43,003
Sleeping with the lights off?

917
00:54:43,730 --> 00:54:44,590
Why?

918
00:54:44,910 --> 00:54:47,612
Are you scared of ghosts?

919
00:54:50,240 --> 00:54:53,009
I think Yotha is scarier.

920
00:54:55,169 --> 00:54:56,387
No,

921
00:54:56,418 --> 00:54:59,150
I was traumatized when I was a kid

922
00:54:59,169 --> 00:55:00,960
so I can’t sleep with the lights off.

923
00:55:00,990 --> 00:55:02,572
So did Yotha.

924
00:55:02,596 --> 00:55:04,301
He got traumatized when he was a kid too.

925
00:55:04,760 --> 00:55:06,295
Yotha never told me that.

926
00:55:06,730 --> 00:55:08,313
Something traumatized him

927
00:55:08,738 --> 00:55:10,480
and it made him scared of love.

928
00:55:16,360 --> 00:55:19,163
New, you’re drunk.

929
00:55:19,193 --> 00:55:21,160
Stop talking about my business.

930
00:55:29,960 --> 00:55:31,606
You said you wouldn’t drink late tonight.

931
00:55:37,050 --> 00:55:38,923
Yotha brought his friend,

932
00:55:38,960 --> 00:55:40,258
so I stayed a bit.

933
00:55:41,660 --> 00:55:43,095
What are you up to this time?

934
00:55:44,640 --> 00:55:45,458
Klao.

935
00:55:52,990 --> 00:55:54,553
Since you started talking about Yotha,

936
00:55:54,578 --> 00:55:56,147
you haven’t stopped smiling.

937
00:55:56,720 --> 00:55:59,507
It’s the Perfect 10 Liners bracelet, Gun.

938
00:55:59,532 --> 00:56:02,295
If you’re dating a member of our group,

939
00:56:02,338 --> 00:56:03,544
you’ll get to wear it.

940
00:56:03,581 --> 00:56:04,744
Maybe Yotha.

941
00:56:04,775 --> 00:56:05,218
Yes?

942
00:56:05,249 --> 00:56:06,301
Please.

943
00:56:06,332 --> 00:56:06,953
Share one with me.

944
00:56:06,984 --> 00:56:08,393
I want to wear it too.

945
00:56:08,418 --> 00:56:09,501
Don’t tell me

946
00:56:09,538 --> 00:56:10,664
That you

947
00:56:10,676 --> 00:56:11,920
Like Yotha.

948
00:56:11,944 --> 00:56:13,150
You like my brother, Gun?

949
00:56:13,181 --> 00:56:13,723
Gun!

950
00:56:14,200 --> 00:56:14,892
Beagle.

951
00:56:17,080 --> 00:56:18,036
You like me?
