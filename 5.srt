Viewer discretion is advised.

4
00:00:17,286 --> 00:00:22,977
Every member of the Perfect 10 Liners
has a pair of
symbolic magnetic bracelets.

5
00:00:22,977 --> 00:00:25,641
If Arc still has both bracelets,

6
00:00:25,641 --> 00:00:27,555
it means he's not taken.

7
00:00:27,776 --> 00:00:29,768
You both are getting a partner!

8
00:00:30,387 --> 00:00:32,387
Who's Tawan?

9
00:00:32,480 --> 00:00:34,362
He's just the first member of Perfect 10 Liners.

10
00:00:34,694 --> 00:00:35,717
Anyone who hurts you,

11
00:00:36,601 --> 00:00:37,738
I'll make them pay.

12
00:00:39,949 --> 00:00:41,788
You mean I'm your person?

13
00:00:42,385 --> 00:00:43,302
Do you want to be?

14
00:00:44,164 --> 00:00:44,921
If you don't answer,

15
00:00:45,545 --> 00:00:46,816
I'll take that as a yes.

16
00:00:48,585 --> 00:00:49,941
Is every major here?

17
00:00:50,361 --> 00:00:52,483
Okay. I've called you all here today

18
00:00:52,483 --> 00:00:54,898
because I have an important announcement.

19
00:00:54,898 --> 00:00:58,204
About the Engineers Unite event we mentioned before,

20
00:00:58,204 --> 00:00:59,341
I have two updates for you.

21
00:00:59,341 --> 00:01:00,951
I'll do anything,

22
00:01:01,106 --> 00:01:03,014
but I'm definitely not playing football.

23
00:01:03,191 --> 00:01:05,123
Over my dead body.

24
00:01:05,344 --> 00:01:07,083
Calm down, Po.

25
00:01:07,216 --> 00:01:09,440
The faculty already has their competing team,

26
00:01:09,440 --> 00:01:11,760
like Arc and Sand.

27
00:01:12,040 --> 00:01:13,778
It won't affect us.

28
00:01:15,000 --> 00:01:16,125
Po!

29
00:01:20,657 --> 00:01:21,453
Don't beg me.

30
00:01:21,829 --> 00:01:22,329
Get the ball.

31
00:01:25,933 --> 00:01:27,656
Right, Arm?

32
00:01:27,656 --> 00:01:29,277
It won't affect us, will it?

33
00:01:32,770 --> 00:01:33,443
Arm?

34
00:01:37,003 --> 00:01:37,914
If you don't answer,

35
00:01:39,440 --> 00:01:40,695
I'll take that as a yes.

36
00:01:58,737 --> 00:01:59,802
You'll get it soon.

37
00:02:01,659 --> 00:02:02,490
No need to rush.

38
00:02:05,143 --> 00:02:05,675
Arm?

39
00:02:06,471 --> 00:02:07,263
- Arm!
- What?

40
00:02:07,263 --> 00:02:08,174
I didn't kiss.

41
00:02:08,174 --> 00:02:08,680
I only touched.

42
00:02:08,680 --> 00:02:09,622
Huh?

43
00:02:14,884 --> 00:02:15,607
Kiss what?

44
00:02:16,757 --> 00:02:17,727
I didn't kiss.

45
00:02:18,280 --> 00:02:19,061
Oh, he didn't kiss.

46
00:02:19,061 --> 00:02:20,295
It's nothing.

47
00:02:21,120 --> 00:02:22,345
What did you touch?

48
00:02:23,495 --> 00:02:25,426
I want to eat rice with fish.

49
00:02:25,824 --> 00:02:27,924
What does rice with fish
have to do with what you said earlier?

50
00:02:28,720 --> 00:02:30,142
I'll take you to eat it after this meeting.

51
00:02:30,385 --> 00:02:31,125
Okay.

52
00:02:41,274 --> 00:02:42,741
Guys,

53
00:02:42,741 --> 00:02:44,807
let me remind you again

54
00:02:45,028 --> 00:02:49,383
that all first-year students must join the activities.

55
00:02:50,200 --> 00:02:54,226
I'll let Jet and Arc explain the details.

56
00:02:54,580 --> 00:02:55,387
Go ahead.

57
00:02:55,896 --> 00:02:56,409
Me?

58
00:02:58,443 --> 00:02:59,063
Let's go.

59
00:03:04,126 --> 00:03:05,944
Hi, all first-year students.

60
00:03:06,143 --> 00:03:08,743
I want to announce that

61
00:03:08,743 --> 00:03:13,282
our team is now accepting applications
for football tryouts

62
00:03:13,923 --> 00:03:17,436
If anyone's interested,
meet us in front of the stage after this meeting.

63
00:03:17,436 --> 00:03:18,382
Sound good?

64
00:03:18,382 --> 00:03:20,545
Yes.

65
00:03:22,800 --> 00:03:24,534
Damn it, Po!

66
00:03:24,534 --> 00:03:25,192
You should join them!

67
00:03:25,192 --> 00:03:25,692
Hey!

68
00:03:26,040 --> 00:03:27,129
Our friend has fainted.

69
00:03:27,129 --> 00:03:27,753
It's okay.

70
00:03:27,753 --> 00:03:30,652
The important thing is, as Yeepun said,

71
00:03:30,652 --> 00:03:32,999
all first-year students must join the activities this year.

72
00:03:32,999 --> 00:03:36,896
There are many other tasks and responsibilities
you can choose from,

73
00:03:36,896 --> 00:03:39,712
so pick what you like or what you're good at,
and don't forget to sign up.

74
00:03:41,901 --> 00:03:42,844
Okay.

75
00:03:43,684 --> 00:03:45,699
Arc, do you have anything to say?

76
00:03:46,628 --> 00:03:47,841
No, I don't.

77
00:03:48,659 --> 00:03:49,517
Come on, say something.

78
00:03:49,517 --> 00:03:50,582
Everyone's waiting to hear from you.

79
00:03:51,599 --> 00:03:53,259
No, you talk to them.

80
00:03:55,249 --> 00:03:58,129
Everyone, please listen to Arc.

81
00:03:58,129 --> 00:03:59,008
Jet! You're crazy!

82
00:04:02,833 --> 00:04:03,495
Arm.

83
00:04:06,347 --> 00:04:07,368
What are you doing for the event?

84
00:04:09,004 --> 00:04:10,141
I asked what you're doing.

85
00:04:10,141 --> 00:04:11,569
Nothing yet.

86
00:04:11,569 --> 00:04:13,030
Then you'll take care of the athletes.

87
00:04:13,959 --> 00:04:14,906
Oh,

88
00:04:15,061 --> 00:04:16,862
you'll take care of the athletes, right, Arm?

89
00:04:17,746 --> 00:04:18,943
Let me put his name down.

90
00:04:18,943 --> 00:04:19,600
There's no need.

91
00:04:21,214 --> 00:04:23,061
He'll only take care of
the one in his peer mentoring group.

92
00:04:33,054 --> 00:04:34,555
Damn it!

93
00:04:38,424 --> 00:04:39,625
Alright, everyone.

94
00:04:39,802 --> 00:04:41,000
Can I have your attention again?

95
00:04:41,000 --> 00:04:42,882
I have another announcement.

96
00:04:42,882 --> 00:04:45,514
Since we're drawing secret buddies,

97
00:04:45,514 --> 00:04:49,137
I want you to take care of your buddy from another university.

98
00:04:49,137 --> 00:04:50,146
Okay?

99
00:04:50,566 --> 00:04:54,797
I've already sent the hints for the names
to the faculty's group chat.

100
00:04:54,797 --> 00:04:55,851
You can check them out.

101
00:04:56,116 --> 00:04:59,879
Enjoy your weekend
and make sure you find out who your buddy is.

102
00:05:00,763 --> 00:05:02,432
Yay!

103
00:05:04,823 --> 00:05:06,214
- Bye.
- Bye.

104
00:05:06,214 --> 00:05:07,360
Let's go. Damn it!

105
00:05:07,360 --> 00:05:08,744
Let's go.

106
00:05:08,744 --> 00:05:09,364
Come on, Sand!

107
00:05:09,364 --> 00:05:10,977
If anyone's interested, don't forget to sign up.

108
00:05:12,679 --> 00:05:14,440
Bye.

109
00:05:14,440 --> 00:05:15,300
Hey, take your friend with you.

110
00:05:15,565 --> 00:05:16,795
I don't see him.

111
00:05:18,000 --> 00:05:18,658
Po.

112
00:05:19,631 --> 00:05:20,318
Po.

113
00:05:21,158 --> 00:05:21,912
Po!

114
00:07:00,592 --> 00:07:02,265
The name is related to nature.

115
00:07:02,619 --> 00:07:04,453
The size is vast.

116
00:07:05,520 --> 00:07:07,745
It's on top of the world.

117
00:07:09,116 --> 00:07:09,852
What the hell is this?

118
00:07:10,560 --> 00:07:12,318
Your hints are so exaggerated.

119
00:07:13,379 --> 00:07:14,431
Related to nature?

120
00:07:14,431 --> 00:07:14,935
Yeah.

121
00:07:15,040 --> 00:07:16,235
On top of the world?

122
00:07:16,235 --> 00:07:16,992
Yeah.

123
00:07:17,324 --> 00:07:17,926
Oh!

124
00:07:19,717 --> 00:07:20,595
I know who it is.

125
00:07:23,425 --> 00:07:24,341
Hungry ghost.

126
00:07:25,933 --> 00:07:27,207
You're better off not knowing.

127
00:07:27,207 --> 00:07:28,902
Who would actually go by the name ‘hungry ghost'?

128
00:07:29,079 --> 00:07:29,789
You're right.

129
00:07:30,480 --> 00:07:32,099
What could it be?

130
00:07:32,200 --> 00:07:34,757
Oh, I know what it is, Po!

131
00:07:34,757 --> 00:07:35,674
This time, I won't get it wrong.

132
00:07:35,674 --> 00:07:36,507
He's confident now.

133
00:07:37,347 --> 00:07:38,389
Himalayas.

134
00:07:39,097 --> 00:07:40,421
That's too much of nature.

135
00:07:42,000 --> 00:07:42,829
What on earth could it be?

136
00:07:42,829 --> 00:07:43,449
Hey!

137
00:07:44,400 --> 00:07:45,238
It's Arc.

138
00:07:47,117 --> 00:07:48,283
Come on, Po.

139
00:07:48,482 --> 00:07:49,295
You idiot.

140
00:07:50,179 --> 00:07:52,295
How can my buddy from another university be Arc?

141
00:07:52,914 --> 00:07:55,769
Besides, his name doesn't even match the hints.

142
00:07:55,769 --> 00:07:56,603
Nature?

143
00:07:57,686 --> 00:08:01,729
He's more like a natural disaster.

144
00:08:02,282 --> 00:08:05,663
Damn, that's so clever.

145
00:08:05,774 --> 00:08:06,745
A natural disaster.

146
00:08:06,745 --> 00:08:07,273
Arm.

147
00:08:07,273 --> 00:08:09,211
Tone it down.

148
00:08:09,211 --> 00:08:11,250
A natural disaster has come to you.

149
00:08:20,403 --> 00:08:22,756
Is my timing from hell again?

150
00:08:23,213 --> 00:08:23,981
Yeah.

151
00:08:24,342 --> 00:08:26,086
Hell must be giving me a death stare.

152
00:08:27,677 --> 00:08:28,645
Damn it.

153
00:08:29,176 --> 00:08:32,253
Why is it always me?

154
00:08:32,518 --> 00:08:35,313
Hell probably likes you.

155
00:08:35,313 --> 00:08:35,813
Yeah.

156
00:08:35,813 --> 00:08:36,683
I think so too.

157
00:08:36,800 --> 00:08:39,962
Hell probably wants us gone.

158
00:08:41,134 --> 00:08:42,014
Sand.

159
00:08:42,606 --> 00:08:43,408
It's hot here.

160
00:08:43,408 --> 00:08:44,130
It's like I'm in hell.

161
00:08:55,896 --> 00:08:56,963
You came all the way to see me.

162
00:08:58,112 --> 00:08:59,342
Is there anything you want to talk about,
peer mentor's mentor?

163
00:09:04,781 --> 00:09:05,851
Are you avoiding me?

164
00:09:06,758 --> 00:09:07,488
No.

165
00:09:08,460 --> 00:09:09,350
Who would do that?

166
00:09:09,593 --> 00:09:10,561
When have I ever done that?

167
00:09:11,644 --> 00:09:12,820
You know what you're doing.

168
00:09:15,075 --> 00:09:15,756
Excuse me.

169
00:09:16,685 --> 00:09:18,143
When did I avoid you?

170
00:09:18,320 --> 00:09:20,286
You didn't have practice today, did you?

171
00:09:20,286 --> 00:09:21,697
You didn't call, so I went back to my dorm.

172
00:09:22,250 --> 00:09:23,230
Are you confused?

173
00:09:23,400 --> 00:09:24,234
Hey.

174
00:09:24,809 --> 00:09:27,020
Aren't you going to take responsibility
for what happened?

175
00:09:27,020 --> 00:09:28,279
Huh, Arm?

176
00:09:29,782 --> 00:09:30,534
Hey!

177
00:09:32,988 --> 00:09:34,661
Who exactly should be the one
taking responsibility here?

178
00:09:35,744 --> 00:09:38,085
I was just sitting there and you kissed…

179
00:09:40,009 --> 00:09:40,965
What did he say?

180
00:09:40,965 --> 00:09:41,542
Yeah, what?

181
00:09:41,874 --> 00:09:42,739
No, no, no.

182
00:09:43,579 --> 00:09:47,713
You touched your lips to mine first.

183
00:09:48,000 --> 00:09:49,564
How do you want me to take responsibility?

184
00:09:50,647 --> 00:09:52,038
Do you want to kiss me back?

185
00:09:52,148 --> 00:09:52,648
Here you go.

186
00:09:52,648 --> 00:09:53,231
Hey!

187
00:09:54,000 --> 00:09:54,568
Stop it!

188
00:09:56,027 --> 00:09:56,873
No!

189
00:09:56,873 --> 00:09:57,512
Go away!

190
00:10:00,099 --> 00:10:01,685
Do what back?

191
00:10:02,061 --> 00:10:03,165
What are they talking about?

192
00:10:03,165 --> 00:10:04,283
The table is not in the right spot.

193
00:10:06,406 --> 00:10:07,562
I won't hold it against you.

194
00:10:08,358 --> 00:10:10,640
I'll just think that we were drunk that day.

195
00:10:12,365 --> 00:10:15,960
Drunk on the chemicals in the lab.

196
00:10:16,734 --> 00:10:17,852
But I mind.

197
00:10:18,648 --> 00:10:21,722
I'm not letting this go, Arm.

198
00:10:21,722 --> 00:10:22,909
Are you out of your mind?

199
00:10:23,418 --> 00:10:25,119
I should be the one not willing to let it slide.

200
00:10:25,119 --> 00:10:26,177
If we really think about it,

201
00:10:26,177 --> 00:10:27,855
I'm the victim here.

202
00:10:29,845 --> 00:10:31,204
I'm affected too.

203
00:10:31,337 --> 00:10:32,352
What do you mean you're affected?

204
00:10:32,352 --> 00:10:33,699
You're not.

205
00:10:34,009 --> 00:10:35,473
You're the one who kissed me!

206
00:10:43,764 --> 00:10:45,231
You made me catch feelings.

207
00:10:47,840 --> 00:10:48,727
I'm affected.

208
00:10:49,302 --> 00:10:50,232
My heart is.

209
00:11:01,622 --> 00:11:02,355
What are you doing?

210
00:11:02,753 --> 00:11:03,556
Do you have a fever?

211
00:11:04,219 --> 00:11:06,055
You don't sound like the Arc I know.

212
00:11:10,123 --> 00:11:11,720
Pun sent me Tawan's address.

213
00:11:11,720 --> 00:11:12,920
It's on a beach near Bangkok.

214
00:11:13,119 --> 00:11:14,462
I'll pick you up from the dorm at 7 a.m. tomorrow.

215
00:11:14,705 --> 00:11:15,768
We'll stay there for one night.

216
00:11:15,768 --> 00:11:16,946
Pack your clothes.

217
00:11:17,256 --> 00:11:17,858
I'm leaving.

218
00:11:26,105 --> 00:11:27,034
I can't believe I said that.

219
00:11:30,146 --> 00:11:32,359
Was that really Arc?

220
00:11:32,735 --> 00:11:34,079
Was it his avatar?

221
00:11:36,555 --> 00:11:38,149
Or am I the avatar?

222
00:11:38,569 --> 00:11:39,244
Ouch!

223
00:11:41,234 --> 00:11:42,495
It hurts.

224
00:11:42,495 --> 00:11:42,995
What?

225
00:11:44,233 --> 00:11:45,520
No. It can't be true.

226
00:11:45,675 --> 00:11:46,678
How can it be true?

227
00:11:47,275 --> 00:11:48,474
Am I haunted by a ghost?

228
00:11:48,894 --> 00:11:49,610
No!

229
00:11:52,219 --> 00:11:53,634
Eat it and grow up.

230
00:12:00,886 --> 00:12:01,637
Hey, Warm.

231
00:12:02,345 --> 00:12:02,845
Hey.

232
00:12:05,012 --> 00:12:07,261
Forcing me to come to your room like this

233
00:12:07,416 --> 00:12:08,823
means you have something important.

234
00:12:10,769 --> 00:12:12,800
I'll get to the point then.

235
00:12:13,419 --> 00:12:14,237
Okay.

236
00:12:17,111 --> 00:12:18,320
I kissed him.

237
00:12:20,022 --> 00:12:20,749
Just a kiss?

238
00:12:21,125 --> 00:12:22,763
Yes, just a kiss.

239
00:12:22,940 --> 00:12:25,079
But a kiss is already too much.

240
00:12:25,079 --> 00:12:26,401
We're not anything yet.

241
00:12:26,401 --> 00:12:28,421
Besides, I didn't ask for permission to kiss him.

242
00:12:29,394 --> 00:12:30,391
You took advantage of him?

243
00:12:32,779 --> 00:12:33,752
Not really.

244
00:12:34,150 --> 00:12:37,257
When I kissed him, he wasn't sleeping or drunk.

245
00:12:37,810 --> 00:12:39,675
He was just drowsy from waking up.

246
00:12:40,604 --> 00:12:43,350
What were you thinking when you kissed him?

247
00:12:45,229 --> 00:12:46,137
I didn't think.

248
00:12:46,557 --> 00:12:47,547
If I had, I wouldn't have done it.

249
00:12:48,741 --> 00:12:49,372
Right.

250
00:12:49,969 --> 00:12:52,513
No one uses their brain
when it comes to matters of the heart.

251
00:12:54,080 --> 00:12:57,458
What else are you worried about?

252
00:13:01,460 --> 00:13:02,832
I'm worried he might not like it

253
00:13:03,606 --> 00:13:05,757
and distance himself from me.

254
00:13:05,757 --> 00:13:07,347
I'm worried he didn't feel anything and…

255
00:13:07,347 --> 00:13:09,685
Did he show you that?

256
00:13:10,967 --> 00:13:12,082
No.

257
00:13:12,369 --> 00:13:14,238
He's still trying to get on my nerves like usual.

258
00:13:14,238 --> 00:13:15,350
He talks to me nicely

259
00:13:15,770 --> 00:13:19,150
and even agreed to go on an errand out of town with me.

260
00:13:20,454 --> 00:13:21,411
What errand?

261
00:13:23,777 --> 00:13:24,891
We're going to see Tawan.

262
00:13:25,974 --> 00:13:27,137
Oh.

263
00:13:27,292 --> 00:13:29,857
For the bracelet thing you never cared about?

264
00:13:30,896 --> 00:13:31,471
Yeah.

265
00:13:32,002 --> 00:13:34,640
Isn't Yeepun supposed to be the one taking Arm there?

266
00:13:36,608 --> 00:13:39,436
She asked me to go with him.

267
00:13:41,072 --> 00:13:44,744
The whole world already knows how you feel.

268
00:13:45,495 --> 00:13:46,362
How?

269
00:13:46,760 --> 00:13:47,921
I've never told anyone.

270
00:13:49,070 --> 00:13:52,022
I know love is hard,

271
00:13:53,260 --> 00:13:55,387
but you've come to the right person for advice.

272
00:14:14,490 --> 00:14:15,439
Hi, Pun.

273
00:14:16,191 --> 00:14:17,941
Can you send me a cute photo?

274
00:14:20,152 --> 00:14:20,961
My photo?

275
00:14:21,580 --> 00:14:22,570
Yes.

276
00:14:22,760 --> 00:14:25,668
The Engineer Cute Boy page has been quiet lately.

277
00:14:26,022 --> 00:14:27,659
I haven't had time to take photos of anyone.

278
00:14:27,902 --> 00:14:30,447
Have you taken any photos of anyone, Arm?

279
00:14:30,447 --> 00:14:33,076
Hmm, no.

280
00:14:33,739 --> 00:14:35,015
Can I post your photo then?

281
00:14:35,170 --> 00:14:37,947
I'll take more of the others at Engineers Unite for stock.

282
00:14:38,566 --> 00:14:41,162
Alright, I'll find one for you.

283
00:14:41,582 --> 00:14:42,525
Thanks.

284
00:14:43,343 --> 00:14:44,083
Bye.

285
00:14:48,350 --> 00:14:49,651
My photo?

286
00:14:51,575 --> 00:14:52,732
Which one should I send?

287
00:14:54,640 --> 00:14:56,182
Why do I look boring in all these photos?

288
00:14:56,735 --> 00:14:58,022
Let me take a new one.

289
00:15:06,000 --> 00:15:08,766
DON'T FORGET TO SEND ME YOUR PHOTO.

290
00:15:12,326 --> 00:15:14,163
ARM FROM ELECTRICAL ENGINEERING
SAYS GOODNIGHT >_<
/ ADMIN FROM THE LAND OF RISING SUN

291
00:15:14,318 --> 00:15:15,514
Not this freaking page again.

292
00:15:27,395 --> 00:15:28,394
Are you going to sleep already?

293
00:15:29,125 --> 00:15:29,625
Yeah.

294
00:15:31,766 --> 00:15:32,266
Damn.

295
00:15:33,051 --> 00:15:36,870
Without Po, the beds are so spacious.

296
00:15:37,672 --> 00:15:38,904
Yeah, that's true.

297
00:15:40,099 --> 00:15:41,715
But isn't he coming back on Monday?

298
00:15:42,482 --> 00:15:42,982
Yeah.

299
00:15:43,874 --> 00:15:44,622
What about you?

300
00:15:45,460 --> 00:15:46,780
Aren't you going home this weekend?

301
00:15:47,544 --> 00:15:48,169
No.

302
00:15:48,454 --> 00:15:49,235
I have plans.

303
00:15:49,520 --> 00:15:51,437
Plus, my mom doesn't really want me to go home

304
00:15:51,615 --> 00:15:52,397
because it'd mean more money spent on food.

305
00:15:52,825 --> 00:15:53,907
I agree with her.

306
00:15:54,371 --> 00:15:55,215
Excuse me?

307
00:15:56,142 --> 00:15:56,911
By the way, Sand.

308
00:15:58,391 --> 00:16:00,132
I'm going out of town tomorrow.

309
00:16:00,292 --> 00:16:03,226
I should be back around Sunday evening.

310
00:16:04,367 --> 00:16:05,012
Where are you going?

311
00:16:06,438 --> 00:16:07,036
To the beach.

312
00:16:08,106 --> 00:16:09,107
Are you going with Arc?

313
00:16:09,374 --> 00:16:11,968
I have to get…

314
00:16:14,090 --> 00:16:16,754
Whoa, why is your chat blowing up like that?

315
00:16:16,920 --> 00:16:17,978
Who did you piss off this time?

316
00:16:18,780 --> 00:16:20,406
It's just like when Arc was scolding you.

317
00:16:20,709 --> 00:16:21,449
It's nothing like that.

318
00:16:22,662 --> 00:16:24,377
Pun just posted my photo on her page.

319
00:16:24,377 --> 00:16:26,230
It's probably the like notifications.

320
00:16:29,297 --> 00:16:30,209
Anol.

321
00:16:30,369 --> 00:16:31,105
It's Arc.

322
00:16:33,816 --> 00:16:36,097
Damn. Here we go.

323
00:16:36,561 --> 00:16:37,216
DELETE THIS.

324
00:16:40,105 --> 00:16:40,852
Answer him.

325
00:16:41,636 --> 00:16:42,146
Okay.

326
00:16:48,084 --> 00:16:48,779
WHY?

327
00:16:48,779 --> 00:16:50,976
WE GOT PERMISSION
FROM THE PERSON IN THE PHOTO.

328
00:16:51,101 --> 00:16:52,901
THERE SHOULDN'T BE ANY PROBLEMS.

329
00:16:58,579 --> 00:16:59,784
I'M ARM'S PEER MENTORING GROUP.

330
00:16:59,909 --> 00:17:00,752
PLEASE DELETE THE PHOTO.

331
00:17:03,302 --> 00:17:04,461
What's gotten into him now?

332
00:17:06,351 --> 00:17:08,352
THIS PERSON IS NOT PUBLIC PROPERTY.

333
00:17:08,352 --> 00:17:09,640
HE'S IN MY GROUP.

334
00:17:09,640 --> 00:17:10,787
I'M POSSESSIVE OF MY PERSON.

335
00:17:15,263 --> 00:17:15,782
Oh.

336
00:17:16,638 --> 00:17:17,214
Come on.

337
00:17:17,214 --> 00:17:19,119
I haven't finished reading what Arc sent.

338
00:17:19,119 --> 00:17:20,000
Let me read it.

339
00:17:20,200 --> 00:17:21,101
It's nothing.

340
00:17:21,101 --> 00:17:22,213
Let me read it.

341
00:17:22,213 --> 00:17:22,905
I'll be right back.

342
00:17:22,905 --> 00:17:23,605
Let me read it.

343
00:17:23,605 --> 00:17:24,711
Arm!

344
00:17:24,711 --> 00:17:25,972
Hey! Let me read it.

345
00:17:26,115 --> 00:17:27,531
Hey! Arm!

346
00:17:27,531 --> 00:17:28,082
I need to pee.

347
00:17:28,403 --> 00:17:28,929
Pee?

348
00:17:29,072 --> 00:17:30,235
You can just go here.

349
00:17:31,269 --> 00:17:31,885
Wow.

350
00:17:32,331 --> 00:17:34,520
Oh, he's keeping secrets from his friend these days.

351
00:17:37,890 --> 00:17:39,397
The collar on your T-shirt is so loose.

352
00:17:39,664 --> 00:17:40,628
Why haven't you thrown it out?

353
00:17:44,087 --> 00:17:45,014
What's your problem?

354
00:17:45,585 --> 00:17:46,705
Where did they get that photo?

355
00:17:47,383 --> 00:17:47,883
Photo?

356
00:17:49,274 --> 00:17:50,185
What photo?

357
00:17:50,399 --> 00:17:51,594
I have no idea.

358
00:17:52,682 --> 00:17:54,534
The one on that Cute page.

359
00:17:56,067 --> 00:17:56,861
Oh,

360
00:17:57,360 --> 00:17:58,175
uh,

361
00:17:59,423 --> 00:18:00,391
I sent it to them myself.

362
00:18:00,605 --> 00:18:01,754
A senior asked me for it.

363
00:18:02,057 --> 00:18:02,596
A senior?

364
00:18:06,590 --> 00:18:07,153
Who?

365
00:18:08,883 --> 00:18:09,486
A senior.

366
00:18:12,517 --> 00:18:13,718
I don't know the name.

367
00:18:14,431 --> 00:18:15,487
But they already deleted it, didn't they?

368
00:18:15,754 --> 00:18:17,158
Just forget about it.

369
00:18:19,387 --> 00:18:19,887
Really?

370
00:18:20,190 --> 00:18:20,698
Yeah.

371
00:18:23,602 --> 00:18:24,102
Okay.

372
00:18:24,102 --> 00:18:24,659
Fine.

373
00:18:24,659 --> 00:18:25,678
It's a good thing they deleted it.

374
00:18:26,997 --> 00:18:27,959
It was hurting people's eyes.

375
00:18:30,224 --> 00:18:31,380
Is that all you called to say?

376
00:18:31,505 --> 00:18:32,086
Wait.

377
00:18:32,871 --> 00:18:34,179
Promise me

378
00:18:34,482 --> 00:18:35,920
you won't send your photos to anyone again.

379
00:18:36,134 --> 00:18:38,136
Why should I promise you that?

380
00:18:38,564 --> 00:18:39,760
Because I'm telling you not to send them.

381
00:18:39,938 --> 00:18:40,627
Hold on.

382
00:18:41,162 --> 00:18:42,494
They're my photos.

383
00:18:42,494 --> 00:18:43,757
And it's not even your face.

384
00:18:44,114 --> 00:18:45,222
What's wrong with you?

385
00:18:45,686 --> 00:18:46,924
I'm telling you not to send them.

386
00:18:46,924 --> 00:18:47,899
Don't you get it?

387
00:18:49,040 --> 00:18:49,556
Why?

388
00:18:50,145 --> 00:18:52,361
Are you worried about people's eyes?

389
00:18:52,361 --> 00:18:54,448
I might not be handsome,
but I'm charming.

390
00:18:54,537 --> 00:18:56,418
It's my photos and my face.

391
00:18:56,418 --> 00:18:58,231
The loose pajama top is mine too.

392
00:18:58,552 --> 00:19:00,049
It's really comfortable to sleep in.

393
00:19:00,049 --> 00:19:02,606
It's my right to send my photos to whoever I want,
or post whatever I want.

394
00:19:02,963 --> 00:19:03,463
Huh?

395
00:19:04,087 --> 00:19:05,159
You're an adult.

396
00:19:05,159 --> 00:19:06,386
Stop being unreasonable.

397
00:19:09,417 --> 00:19:10,199
I'm possessive of you.

398
00:19:10,520 --> 00:19:12,343
Is that enough of a reason?

399
00:19:19,342 --> 00:19:20,908
Alright, I have to go.

400
00:19:20,908 --> 00:19:21,408
I'm going to sleep now.

401
00:19:21,408 --> 00:19:22,469
Don't we have to wake up early tomorrow?

402
00:19:22,469 --> 00:19:22,969
Wait.

403
00:19:23,147 --> 00:19:24,112
You haven't answered me.

404
00:19:24,415 --> 00:19:25,236
Answer what?

405
00:19:25,539 --> 00:19:27,518
I asked if that's enough of a reason.

406
00:19:27,518 --> 00:19:29,562
If not, I'll find more reasons for you.

407
00:19:29,562 --> 00:19:31,975
For example, you're too cute.

408
00:19:31,975 --> 00:19:33,131
I don't want anyone else looking at you.

409
00:19:33,541 --> 00:19:34,457
Or maybe….

410
00:19:34,457 --> 00:19:35,905
Alright, I have to go.

411
00:19:35,905 --> 00:19:36,618
I'm going to sleep now.

412
00:19:36,920 --> 00:19:37,621
Bye.

413
00:19:38,120 --> 00:19:38,913
See you tomorrow.

414
00:19:39,412 --> 00:19:40,164
Good night, Arm.

415
00:19:54,755 --> 00:19:56,820
Oh.

416
00:19:57,248 --> 00:20:00,251
Did Arc make you so angry you're blushing?

417
00:20:01,570 --> 00:20:02,660
I'm not blushing.

418
00:20:02,910 --> 00:20:04,566
It was windy.

419
00:20:04,922 --> 00:20:06,178
I put my face against the wind.

420
00:20:06,178 --> 00:20:07,223
That's why my face is red.

421
00:20:08,293 --> 00:20:10,124
Right.

422
00:20:10,695 --> 00:20:13,039
You're not blushing because you're shy talking to Arc.

423
00:20:15,040 --> 00:20:16,885
Shut up, Sand!

424
00:20:19,435 --> 00:20:21,308
He likes you.

425
00:20:22,734 --> 00:20:23,450
He likes you!

426
00:20:23,593 --> 00:20:25,333
Damn it!

427
00:20:25,333 --> 00:20:25,861
Damn!

428
00:20:28,500 --> 00:20:32,971
Sand, do you think I like him at all?

429
00:20:33,114 --> 00:20:33,755
Come on.

430
00:20:34,326 --> 00:20:36,544
You should be asking yourself that, not me.

431
00:20:38,077 --> 00:20:41,605
You know that I have my answer.

432
00:20:51,046 --> 00:20:51,920
Listen to me, Arm.

433
00:20:52,916 --> 00:20:54,840
Other people have chosen to be happy.

434
00:20:56,053 --> 00:20:57,125
Look around you.

435
00:20:58,909 --> 00:21:01,924
Right now, you're the only one too afraid to move on.

436
00:21:04,438 --> 00:21:05,827
But I think…

437
00:21:05,827 --> 00:21:06,641
I want you

438
00:21:07,319 --> 00:21:08,822
to open up to love again.

439
00:21:10,106 --> 00:21:11,370
It can be anyone.

440
00:21:11,638 --> 00:21:12,803
It doesn't have to be Arc.

441
00:21:13,748 --> 00:21:16,361
I just want you to start over with someone

442
00:21:16,664 --> 00:21:18,232
and learn to love again.

443
00:21:21,085 --> 00:21:22,695
Being in love is good.

444
00:21:29,239 --> 00:21:29,825
Alright.

445
00:21:39,696 --> 00:21:40,784
Is he really coming

446
00:21:42,264 --> 00:21:43,343
or is he just messing with me?

447
00:21:45,625 --> 00:21:46,953
Honestly, I don't even want to go.

448
00:21:47,238 --> 00:21:48,396
I've already been waiting for so long.

449
00:21:49,591 --> 00:21:50,091
Oh.

450
00:21:51,571 --> 00:21:55,314
Was the guy I met from a parallel universe?

451
00:21:55,314 --> 00:21:56,422
Damn it.

452
00:21:56,600 --> 00:21:57,521
I better go to sleep.

453
00:21:58,680 --> 00:22:00,159
Oh, shit!

454
00:22:03,404 --> 00:22:04,161
Get in.

455
00:22:04,607 --> 00:22:06,010
From what you've told me,

456
00:22:06,170 --> 00:22:07,561
I can see two main points.

457
00:22:07,793 --> 00:22:08,339
One,

458
00:22:09,748 --> 00:22:11,516
you're worrying too much about everything.

459
00:22:12,015 --> 00:22:12,724
Two,

460
00:22:13,455 --> 00:22:14,791
he doesn't realize anything.

461
00:22:14,934 --> 00:22:15,895
Then what should I do

462
00:22:16,697 --> 00:22:17,511
to make him realize?

463
00:22:18,100 --> 00:22:21,208
You have to make him feel special.

464
00:22:23,205 --> 00:22:24,467
I thought you weren't going to show up.

465
00:22:24,966 --> 00:22:26,145
I said I would, so here I am.

466
00:22:26,359 --> 00:22:28,531
How is what I'm doing not special?

467
00:22:28,674 --> 00:22:30,121
It has to feel even more special.

468
00:22:31,048 --> 00:22:34,835
Like take care of him, pay attention to him,

469
00:22:35,245 --> 00:22:37,145
and talk nicely to him.

470
00:22:37,912 --> 00:22:39,732
Where should I put this bag?

471
00:22:43,958 --> 00:22:45,229
On your head, maybe.

472
00:22:47,333 --> 00:22:47,886
Like this?

473
00:22:49,063 --> 00:22:49,975
It'll be heavy.

474
00:23:04,463 --> 00:23:06,186
The trunk is so spacious.

475
00:23:07,220 --> 00:23:08,910
Can I sleep here instead of sitting next to you?

476
00:23:11,353 --> 00:23:12,034
Just kidding.

477
00:23:27,560 --> 00:23:30,859
By the way, where are you taking me?

478
00:23:30,859 --> 00:23:31,593
You haven't told me.

479
00:23:32,431 --> 00:23:34,116
I already told you we're going to the beach.

480
00:23:36,113 --> 00:23:37,463
I know we're going to the beach,

481
00:23:38,105 --> 00:23:39,566
but if you're taking me to the Maldives,

482
00:23:39,566 --> 00:23:41,794
I'll need to go upstairs and grab my passport.
Who knows?

483
00:23:43,363 --> 00:23:44,305
You're crazy.

484
00:23:49,957 --> 00:23:51,195
So, are we going to the Maldives?

485
00:24:03,240 --> 00:24:04,705
Your two rooms are ready.

486
00:24:05,436 --> 00:24:06,014
Thank you.

487
00:24:08,100 --> 00:24:10,226
Booking two rooms in a situation like this

488
00:24:10,600 --> 00:24:11,697
doesn't make you look rich.

489
00:24:12,232 --> 00:24:12,931
It makes you look stupid.

490
00:24:14,447 --> 00:24:15,680
I just don't want him to feel uncomfortable.

491
00:24:16,411 --> 00:24:20,742
How do you know when you'll get another chance
to go to another city with him?

492
00:24:20,992 --> 00:24:23,847
A chance like this might not come again.

493
00:24:24,792 --> 00:24:28,472
You have to live every day like it's your last.

494
00:24:45,783 --> 00:24:46,417
Here.

495
00:24:49,127 --> 00:24:50,444
You can keep the keycard.

496
00:24:52,156 --> 00:24:53,399
I always lose it.

497
00:24:54,612 --> 00:24:55,112
Okay.

498
00:24:57,020 --> 00:24:57,913
Where's the room?

499
00:24:58,341 --> 00:24:59,031
Lead the way.

500
00:25:11,988 --> 00:25:13,569
Wow!

501
00:25:20,155 --> 00:25:21,831
This is so soft!

502
00:25:22,403 --> 00:25:24,471
Lying on this reminds me of home.

503
00:25:24,520 --> 00:25:25,125
Why?

504
00:25:25,379 --> 00:25:27,228
Is the bed at your dorm that bad?

505
00:25:27,228 --> 00:25:30,311
Oh, it's terrible.

506
00:25:30,925 --> 00:25:31,840
It's like sleeping on a mat.

507
00:25:32,242 --> 00:25:33,513
You were on it before.

508
00:25:33,513 --> 00:25:34,117
Did you forget?

509
00:25:34,858 --> 00:25:36,372
Mm, right.

510
00:25:36,732 --> 00:25:37,967
I guess I forgot.

511
00:25:38,136 --> 00:25:39,138
But it's okay.

512
00:25:39,456 --> 00:25:41,363
I'll make time to sleep there with you more often.

513
00:25:47,271 --> 00:25:48,421
Where's Tawan?

514
00:25:49,040 --> 00:25:51,090
Can we go get my bracelets made now?

515
00:25:51,200 --> 00:25:54,577
I want to be a verified member of the Perfect 10 Liners.

516
00:25:54,831 --> 00:25:56,597
If you go to his shop now, you won't find him.

517
00:25:56,703 --> 00:25:57,751
He opens at night.

518
00:25:59,530 --> 00:26:00,405
How mysterious.

519
00:26:01,718 --> 00:26:04,967
Are you sure he's not doing something illegal
or shady business?

520
00:26:05,814 --> 00:26:06,419
No idea.

521
00:26:06,843 --> 00:26:08,135
I don't know him personally.

522
00:26:09,279 --> 00:26:10,154
How come you don't know him?

523
00:26:10,832 --> 00:26:12,624
Didn't you get your bracelets made with him?

524
00:26:12,624 --> 00:26:13,249
No.

525
00:26:13,588 --> 00:26:14,652
Jet gave them to me.

526
00:26:14,948 --> 00:26:18,393
Oh, why did you get them so easily?

527
00:26:19,040 --> 00:26:20,829
Why did I have to come all the way here?

528
00:26:26,880 --> 00:26:28,988
You're just normal.

529
00:26:31,910 --> 00:26:34,333
Are you saying you're more privileged than others?

530
00:26:36,680 --> 00:26:38,659
Go wherever you want.

531
00:26:38,659 --> 00:26:39,440
I'm going to sleep.

532
00:26:41,791 --> 00:26:43,361
Hey, Arc!

533
00:26:44,600 --> 00:26:46,051
You can sleep at home.

534
00:26:46,051 --> 00:26:47,618
Let's go play in the water. Come on!

535
00:26:47,618 --> 00:26:49,206
No, it's hot.

536
00:26:49,206 --> 00:26:50,262
I brought sunscreen.

537
00:26:50,400 --> 00:26:53,007
Hey. You're not being polite with me again, Arm.

538
00:26:54,193 --> 00:26:55,675
Sorry.

539
00:26:56,014 --> 00:26:57,469
I'm normally a rude person,

540
00:26:58,295 --> 00:27:01,292
but I'll try to be better for you.

541
00:27:03,770 --> 00:27:04,899
Come on! Let's play in the water!

542
00:27:04,899 --> 00:27:05,592
I'm not going!

543
00:27:05,592 --> 00:27:06,410
Come on!

544
00:27:06,410 --> 00:27:06,910
No!

545
00:27:06,910 --> 00:27:07,946
Come on!

546
00:27:25,604 --> 00:27:26,206
Arc.

547
00:27:30,102 --> 00:27:31,104
Speak nicely

548
00:27:31,697 --> 00:27:32,680
then I'll go play with you.

549
00:27:37,720 --> 00:27:38,738
Phi Arc.

550
00:27:39,966 --> 00:27:41,947
Can you go play in the water with Nong Arm?

551
00:27:45,293 --> 00:27:46,875
Now that makes me want to indulge you.

552
00:27:54,040 --> 00:27:55,226
Let me change my outfit first.

553
00:28:00,816 --> 00:28:01,831
Stop beating so fast!

554
00:28:07,570 --> 00:28:09,056
Whoa!

555
00:28:10,263 --> 00:28:11,431
Let's go!

556
00:28:11,770 --> 00:28:12,990
Come on, Arc!

557
00:28:25,845 --> 00:28:26,642
You're going to get it!

558
00:28:31,301 --> 00:28:31,942
Stop it, Arm!

559
00:28:32,080 --> 00:28:32,882
Go!

560
00:28:38,789 --> 00:28:41,922
♪ Then I can point the finger at who? ♪

561
00:28:44,971 --> 00:28:45,839
I'm so tired.

562
00:28:47,533 --> 00:28:51,109
I can't remember the last time
I went into the sea.

563
00:28:51,490 --> 00:28:52,317
It's been so long.

564
00:29:02,068 --> 00:29:02,959
I remember.

565
00:29:08,719 --> 00:29:09,303
What?

566
00:29:14,364 --> 00:29:21,215
I said I remember the last time I ran into the sea.

567
00:29:25,599 --> 00:29:27,108
I broke up with my partner in the sea.

568
00:29:27,955 --> 00:29:29,089
How romantic is that?

569
00:29:42,412 --> 00:29:47,900
I thought it was love, but I was told it wasn't.

570
00:29:54,359 --> 00:29:56,078
Listen, kid.

571
00:29:57,941 --> 00:30:01,095
People get their hearts broken many times
before they find true love.

572
00:30:02,408 --> 00:30:03,972
Don't look at it as a bad thing just yet.

573
00:30:05,264 --> 00:30:06,579
But it was my first love.

574
00:30:08,231 --> 00:30:10,008
It made me tell myself that….

575
00:30:12,380 --> 00:30:13,109
Tell yourself what?

576
00:30:14,337 --> 00:30:19,178
That I won't love anyone else again.

Is Tawan's shop open yet?

582
00:30:34,863 --> 00:30:35,705
Let's hurry there.

583
00:30:36,086 --> 00:30:37,040
Let's go before it's too late.

584
00:30:51,281 --> 00:30:52,154
I'm out of materials.

585
00:30:52,281 --> 00:30:53,083
We can't make your bracelets.

586
00:30:53,930 --> 00:30:54,430
What?

587
00:30:54,621 --> 00:30:59,338
Didn't Pun tell you
we were coming to get my group bracelets?

588
00:30:59,338 --> 00:31:00,006
She did.

589
00:31:00,938 --> 00:31:01,973
What, Uncle?

590
00:31:02,397 --> 00:31:03,928
Then why didn't you prepare the materials for us?

591
00:31:04,034 --> 00:31:04,856
Don't call me Uncle!

592
00:31:05,936 --> 00:31:07,962
She said you guys would come but didn't tell me when.

593
00:31:09,804 --> 00:31:10,432
Alright.

594
00:31:11,173 --> 00:31:12,488
We'll come back another day.

595
00:31:12,488 --> 00:31:13,517
Let's go, Arm.

596
00:31:13,720 --> 00:31:14,325
Hey!

597
00:31:14,325 --> 00:31:15,155
Wait, Arc!

598
00:31:15,790 --> 00:31:16,454
Uncle!

599
00:31:17,047 --> 00:31:18,410
We've come all the way here.

600
00:31:18,410 --> 00:31:19,489
Do you want us to leave already?

601
00:31:20,717 --> 00:31:22,458
Are you the newest member of Perfect 10 Liners?

602
00:31:23,729 --> 00:31:24,536
Yes. I am.

603
00:31:31,905 --> 00:31:35,650
I know I make your angel group look bad.

604
00:31:36,095 --> 00:31:37,145
What can I do?

605
00:31:37,505 --> 00:31:38,907
It's just my luck.

606
00:31:41,999 --> 00:31:42,936
Sit down and let's talk.

607
00:31:47,891 --> 00:31:48,504
Here.

608
00:31:48,589 --> 00:31:50,299
One, two.

609
00:31:50,426 --> 00:31:51,344
Go!

610
00:31:51,873 --> 00:31:52,446
Wait.

611
00:31:52,785 --> 00:31:53,712
Whose card is this?

612
00:31:55,723 --> 00:31:57,175
Damn it!

613
00:31:57,218 --> 00:31:58,047
It's yours again?

614
00:31:58,047 --> 00:31:59,782
If you're going to keep winning like this,
just play by yourself.

615
00:32:00,206 --> 00:32:01,032
I can't help it.

616
00:32:01,032 --> 00:32:01,825
I'm just too good.

617
00:32:03,159 --> 00:32:04,490
You're too good at this, Warm.

618
00:32:04,490 --> 00:32:05,488
I surrender.

619
00:32:05,869 --> 00:32:06,855
Don't get discouraged.

620
00:32:06,855 --> 00:32:08,600
You'll get better the more you play.

621
00:32:08,791 --> 00:32:09,427
Yes.

622
00:32:09,618 --> 00:32:10,756
I'll bring you here again.

623
00:32:13,149 --> 00:32:13,996
Sounds good.

624
00:32:18,782 --> 00:32:20,642
It's late. Let's go.

625
00:32:20,769 --> 00:32:21,867
We should leave.

626
00:32:22,735 --> 00:32:23,253
Wait.

627
00:32:23,994 --> 00:32:25,541
Are you going back to your condo

628
00:32:26,325 --> 00:32:27,651
or are you going somewhere else?

629
00:32:29,720 --> 00:32:31,179
Why ask if you already know?

630
00:32:33,508 --> 00:32:36,896
Sand, you're getting a good one from our group.

631
00:32:40,887 --> 00:32:41,784
- I'm leaving.
- Let's go.

632
00:32:41,996 --> 00:32:42,529
Oh.

633
00:32:43,503 --> 00:32:45,220
Take care of Copp.

634
00:32:45,813 --> 00:32:47,892
What do you mean by a ‘good one', Warm?

635
00:32:47,892 --> 00:32:48,788
Be careful.

636
00:32:49,254 --> 00:32:50,481
I will.

637
00:32:54,250 --> 00:32:57,605
What's the ‘good one'?

638
00:33:08,738 --> 00:33:09,696
It's right in front of you.

639
00:33:22,949 --> 00:33:25,288
What kind of crazy person praises himself?

640
00:33:26,516 --> 00:33:27,810
I'm not praising myself.

641
00:33:28,043 --> 00:33:29,411
Warm did.

642
00:33:32,820 --> 00:33:33,613
Let's go.

643
00:33:34,524 --> 00:33:35,939
Mm.

644
00:33:36,595 --> 00:33:37,387
Are you hungry?

645
00:33:37,387 --> 00:33:38,408
Or do you want to go home right away?

646
00:33:41,627 --> 00:33:43,136
I want to eat at…

647
00:33:45,910 --> 00:33:46,969
Our usual place.

648
00:33:48,663 --> 00:33:49,190
Yeah.

649
00:33:51,117 --> 00:33:51,951
Then let's go.

650
00:33:52,353 --> 00:33:53,211
Let's go.

651
00:33:53,507 --> 00:33:54,726
Come on.

652
00:33:54,726 --> 00:33:56,215
Let's go.

653
00:33:56,400 --> 00:33:57,466
Okay.

654
00:34:04,242 --> 00:34:05,400
Sorry, we're closed.

655
00:34:05,400 --> 00:34:05,900
Oh?

656
00:34:05,900 --> 00:34:07,275
But the shop is still open.

657
00:34:07,762 --> 00:34:08,581
It's closed.

658
00:34:13,345 --> 00:34:14,611
Wow.

659
00:34:14,696 --> 00:34:15,934
You really don't care.

660
00:34:16,590 --> 00:34:17,921
Even more than I heard people say about you.

661
00:34:18,768 --> 00:34:19,743
What did you hear?

662
00:34:20,802 --> 00:34:22,101
A lot.

663
00:34:22,186 --> 00:34:23,609
Can I ask you something?

664
00:34:24,583 --> 00:34:27,889
What's the story behind the group bracelets?

665
00:34:29,689 --> 00:34:30,594
Not much.

666
00:34:31,483 --> 00:34:33,680
I just wanted the seniors and juniors to bond quickly.

667
00:34:34,336 --> 00:34:37,560
And why do we only recruit good-looking people?

668
00:34:39,296 --> 00:34:41,012
Everyone draws lots to get in.

669
00:34:41,012 --> 00:34:41,810
How's that recruiting?

670
00:34:42,120 --> 00:34:45,681
People just keep saying that we're good-looking.

671
00:34:46,613 --> 00:34:48,134
No matter what you look like, you're all my juniors.

672
00:34:48,706 --> 00:34:51,916
Wow, that's so deep.

673
00:34:53,928 --> 00:34:55,316
I'm so unlucky though.

674
00:34:55,480 --> 00:34:57,361
I didn't get my gear or my pin.

675
00:34:57,721 --> 00:34:59,106
Now, I can't get my group bracelets either.

676
00:35:05,628 --> 00:35:06,791
Say that again.

677
00:35:10,158 --> 00:35:11,437
It's the pin-receiving ceremony today.

678
00:35:23,128 --> 00:35:24,065
You can stop being sad now.

679
00:35:29,232 --> 00:35:30,358
Hey, Arm!

680
00:35:30,358 --> 00:35:34,581
Oh, I got a pin.

681
00:35:34,920 --> 00:35:37,744
I just didn't join the pinning ceremony.

682
00:35:40,010 --> 00:35:43,160
They just do a ceremony
to make it feel sacred when you get it.

683
00:35:44,367 --> 00:35:47,531
If you've been in any situation more sacred than that,
I think that's way cooler.

684
00:35:48,272 --> 00:35:48,931
Really?

685
00:35:48,931 --> 00:35:50,446
Next time you come, I can pin it for you.

686
00:35:50,446 --> 00:35:51,844
Getting pinned by the first member of your group,

687
00:35:52,056 --> 00:35:53,228
by the sea,

688
00:35:53,673 --> 00:35:55,230
is way cooler than in the auditorium if you ask me.

689
00:36:00,120 --> 00:36:02,560
My friends said the pins aren't for sale yet.

690
00:36:02,729 --> 00:36:03,698
It's my pin.

691
00:36:04,418 --> 00:36:04,967
Huh?

692
00:36:09,266 --> 00:36:10,923
Now that you know, don't lose it.

693
00:36:23,592 --> 00:36:24,711
The way you got it was quite sacred.

694
00:36:25,452 --> 00:36:26,446
Why don't you tell him about it?

695
00:36:29,707 --> 00:36:30,234
Really?

696
00:36:31,040 --> 00:36:31,625
How?

697
00:36:34,378 --> 00:36:35,459
Oh,

698
00:36:36,835 --> 00:36:38,291
it's nothing, Tawan.

699
00:36:38,715 --> 00:36:39,269
Let's drink.

700
00:36:39,269 --> 00:36:40,246
Cheers.

701
00:36:40,246 --> 00:36:40,880
Cheers, guys.

702
00:36:40,880 --> 00:36:42,366
Cheers.

703
00:36:44,018 --> 00:36:46,153
Cheers!

704
00:36:54,539 --> 00:36:56,981
Hey, are you dehydrated, Arc?

705
00:36:57,892 --> 00:36:59,803
Does my liquor taste better than in Bangkok or what?

706
00:37:11,873 --> 00:37:12,525
Hey.

707
00:37:13,040 --> 00:37:14,822
If you didn't tell me you're single,

708
00:37:15,118 --> 00:37:17,021
I'd think you're heartbroken, drinking so much like that.

709
00:37:23,480 --> 00:37:24,391
You like him, don't you?

710
00:37:28,266 --> 00:37:28,946
Yes.

711
00:37:29,433 --> 00:37:30,195
But…

712
00:37:30,280 --> 00:37:30,801
But what?

713
00:37:33,660 --> 00:37:35,066
But it feels like he doesn't like me.

714
00:37:35,828 --> 00:37:36,414
Come on.

715
00:37:37,282 --> 00:37:40,001
Jet didn't tell me anything emotional like this.

716
00:37:40,573 --> 00:37:42,106
Arc knows how to love someone?

717
00:37:42,445 --> 00:37:43,482
Exactly.

718
00:37:43,630 --> 00:37:45,712
I couldn't believe it at first,

719
00:37:45,903 --> 00:37:50,910
but this kid has made him hold back his smile
that his face kept contorting.

720
00:37:51,400 --> 00:37:52,321
Has he really fallen that hard?

721
00:37:52,321 --> 00:37:53,680
Yes.

722
00:37:53,680 --> 00:37:54,842
Not only does he smile,

723
00:37:54,842 --> 00:37:57,590
but he keeps following him around to take care of him.

724
00:37:57,590 --> 00:37:59,879
The whole university seems to have caught onto it by now.

725
00:37:59,879 --> 00:38:00,555
That's good.

726
00:38:00,873 --> 00:38:02,705
Only the two of them don't know.

727
00:38:02,705 --> 00:38:03,438
How?

728
00:38:03,756 --> 00:38:06,052
Arc is being tight-lipped as usual.

729
00:38:06,158 --> 00:38:07,474
All he does all day is scolding Arm

730
00:38:07,707 --> 00:38:10,736
and the kid just can't keep up.

731
00:38:11,011 --> 00:38:13,566
So, I think I'm going to need your help.

732
00:38:15,175 --> 00:38:15,812
Hey.

733
00:38:15,812 --> 00:38:16,312
What's the deal?

734
00:38:16,756 --> 00:38:18,042
Am I watching the wrong TV channel?

735
00:38:18,402 --> 00:38:20,114
Why does this feel like a totally different drama?

736
00:38:20,305 --> 00:38:21,686
It's not fun like Jet said it'd be.

737
00:38:22,554 --> 00:38:24,225
It's the same channel.

738
00:38:24,564 --> 00:38:28,727
The ending just might not be a happy one.

739
00:38:30,675 --> 00:38:31,444
What?

740
00:38:31,889 --> 00:38:34,266
It's a series, not a short film.

741
00:38:34,944 --> 00:38:35,893
Why are you rushing it to end?

742
00:38:37,714 --> 00:38:38,625
Do you really think so?

743
00:38:40,721 --> 00:38:41,932
You write your own script.

744
00:38:42,821 --> 00:38:44,355
So just write a new one

745
00:38:44,842 --> 00:38:45,851
to keep it from ending.

754
00:39:13,722 --> 00:39:15,101
Can I enter your room?

755
00:39:16,344 --> 00:39:17,017
Come in.

756
00:39:18,871 --> 00:39:19,806
Don't forget to close the door.

757
00:39:27,155 --> 00:39:29,217
Where are your friends?

758
00:39:30,198 --> 00:39:31,841
Pipo went home

759
00:39:31,841 --> 00:39:33,227
and Arm is with Arc.

760
00:39:34,121 --> 00:39:36,305
There's something going on between Arm and Arc,
don't you think?

761
00:39:39,794 --> 00:39:42,207
I want to ask you something.

762
00:39:43,079 --> 00:39:43,697
Sure.

763
00:39:45,093 --> 00:39:49,200
Do you think Arc likes Arm
more than just as a junior in his group?

764
00:39:49,658 --> 00:39:50,184
Yes.

765
00:39:54,414 --> 00:39:55,696
Is he serious about him?

766
00:39:56,154 --> 00:39:57,165
Why do you ask that?

767
00:39:59,171 --> 00:40:00,498
I'll admit

768
00:40:02,068 --> 00:40:03,189
I'm worried about Arm.

769
00:40:04,737 --> 00:40:06,712
Even though he's cheerful and dumb,

770
00:40:07,214 --> 00:40:09,566
he's not good at love.

771
00:40:09,915 --> 00:40:11,478
He's been hurt badly before.

772
00:40:12,154 --> 00:40:13,504
I don't want him to get hurt again.

773
00:40:15,227 --> 00:40:16,544
Arc is not good at it either.

774
00:40:18,288 --> 00:40:19,186
Really?

775
00:40:19,426 --> 00:40:20,078
Yeah.

776
00:40:20,776 --> 00:40:21,854
Despite how he looks,

777
00:40:22,028 --> 00:40:23,748
he's only dated a few people.

778
00:40:24,598 --> 00:40:26,027
He rarely gets involved with anyone.

779
00:40:27,139 --> 00:40:29,511
Only Arm can mess with his heart like that.

780
00:40:32,477 --> 00:40:35,219
I feel much more relieved to hear that.

781
00:40:37,247 --> 00:40:39,575
Let them slowly get to know each other.

782
00:40:40,709 --> 00:40:41,312
Okay.

783
00:40:54,597 --> 00:40:55,877
Just like how we're getting to know each other.

784
00:41:09,818 --> 00:41:10,444
Hey!

785
00:41:11,709 --> 00:41:13,509
What do you mean by getting to know each other?

786
00:41:17,979 --> 00:41:19,374
I'm hitting on you.
Don't you realize it at all?

787
00:41:21,009 --> 00:41:21,806
You're hitting on me?

788
00:41:22,417 --> 00:41:23,634
Yes, I'm hitting on you.

789
00:41:26,011 --> 00:41:28,320
You're hitting on me

790
00:41:28,320 --> 00:41:29,091
and we're…?

791
00:41:29,091 --> 00:41:29,784
We're flirting…?

792
00:41:29,784 --> 00:41:31,626
Do you want to skip this step
and get together already?

793
00:41:39,869 --> 00:41:41,379
- It's late. You should go.
- Huh?

794
00:41:43,472 --> 00:41:44,158
You should go.

795
00:41:44,376 --> 00:41:45,751
Just go.

796
00:41:47,277 --> 00:41:48,334
It's lonely to sleep alone.

797
00:41:49,315 --> 00:41:50,585
I can sleep alone just fine.

798
00:41:50,781 --> 00:41:52,261
I can keep you company for free.

799
00:41:52,261 --> 00:41:53,029
No, thanks.

800
00:41:56,256 --> 00:41:57,220
You're really not giving in, huh?

801
00:41:58,354 --> 00:41:59,278
Good night.

802
00:41:59,278 --> 00:42:00,008
It's time for you to leave.

803
00:42:00,008 --> 00:42:01,832
Hey.

804
00:42:05,387 --> 00:42:06,238
I'll definitely have a good night.

805
00:42:07,612 --> 00:42:09,053
Just go.

806
00:42:09,053 --> 00:42:10,236
Off you go.

807
00:42:10,361 --> 00:42:11,457
Off you go.

808
00:42:11,457 --> 00:42:13,622
Yay! Off you go!

809
00:42:13,622 --> 00:42:14,322
Bye!

810
00:42:39,100 --> 00:42:40,445
Now I understand how Arm feels.

811
00:42:54,554 --> 00:42:56,356
I should've let him stay over.

812
00:43:09,506 --> 00:43:10,343
Hey!

813
00:43:11,891 --> 00:43:14,680
I got drunk and sobered up,
but you guys are still not drunk?

814
00:43:14,876 --> 00:43:16,421
I was waiting for you to wake up.

815
00:43:16,901 --> 00:43:18,345
If I didn't wake up,

816
00:43:18,345 --> 00:43:20,218
were you just going to keep drinking
until the sun came up?

817
00:43:22,878 --> 00:43:24,927
You're sober now.

818
00:43:25,407 --> 00:43:26,400
Do you want to leave

819
00:43:26,836 --> 00:43:28,605
or do you want to wait to see the sunrise?

820
00:43:29,303 --> 00:43:31,975
No, I can watch it on YouTube.

821
00:43:32,673 --> 00:43:33,681
It's just as beautiful there.

822
00:43:33,812 --> 00:43:34,710
Let's go.

823
00:43:35,233 --> 00:43:37,432
Tomorrow, you have to drive back to Bangkok.

824
00:43:40,080 --> 00:43:41,029
We're leaving, Tawan.

825
00:43:42,250 --> 00:43:44,677
Next time, don't forget my group bracelets.

826
00:43:45,636 --> 00:43:47,142
I want to be verified.

827
00:43:49,650 --> 00:43:50,709
See you next time.

828
00:43:53,849 --> 00:43:54,377
Okay.

829
00:43:55,467 --> 00:43:56,316
See you.

830
00:43:57,248 --> 00:43:57,886
- Safe trip back.
- Bye.

831
00:44:01,240 --> 00:44:02,284
Take care of him.

832
00:44:02,589 --> 00:44:03,640
Damn it!

833
00:44:04,425 --> 00:44:05,636
Walk properly.
Come here!

834
00:44:16,757 --> 00:44:17,778
Walk properly.

835
00:44:20,635 --> 00:44:22,920
Oh, I swear

836
00:44:22,920 --> 00:44:24,903
I won't get drunk again!

837
00:44:24,903 --> 00:44:25,662
Arm.

838
00:44:27,520 --> 00:44:28,020
Hmm?

839
00:44:32,468 --> 00:44:37,377
The real sunrise is more beautiful than on YouTube.

840
00:44:49,061 --> 00:44:50,124
Wow.

841
00:44:51,759 --> 00:44:53,263
It's really more beautiful than on YouTube.

842
00:45:01,746 --> 00:45:02,383
Arm.

843
00:45:04,193 --> 00:45:04,868
Hmm?

844
00:45:06,264 --> 00:45:07,536
You said

845
00:45:10,131 --> 00:45:11,479
you broke up with your ex in the sea.

846
00:45:13,987 --> 00:45:14,631
Why?

847
00:45:15,809 --> 00:45:16,913
Are you going to mock me?

848
00:45:18,047 --> 00:45:20,057
Was I rambling about it last night?

849
00:45:22,565 --> 00:45:23,415
Just forget it.

850
00:45:23,568 --> 00:45:24,351
Don't pay attention.

851
00:45:31,220 --> 00:45:32,339
But I want to pay attention.

852
00:45:46,980 --> 00:45:47,873
Let's break up.

853
00:45:50,293 --> 00:45:52,304
You think I can't live without you, Arm.

854
00:45:53,612 --> 00:45:56,100
It feels like you only feel sorry for me.

855
00:45:56,776 --> 00:45:58,321
I don't think you should love anyone else,

856
00:45:58,714 --> 00:46:02,215
because you're only going to hurt them
like you're hurting me now.

857
00:46:09,215 --> 00:46:11,158
That last thing she said to me

858
00:46:12,401 --> 00:46:13,550
feels like a curse.

859
00:46:20,790 --> 00:46:23,228
Whenever I start to catch feelings for someone,

860
00:46:25,256 --> 00:46:27,206
I keep replaying that sentence in my head.

861
00:46:31,088 --> 00:46:32,368
I shouldn't love anyone else.

862
00:46:35,203 --> 00:46:36,994
I'm only going to hurt them.

863
00:46:41,966 --> 00:46:43,147
That's why I'm scared.

864
00:46:46,527 --> 00:46:48,057
I'm too scared to open up to love again.

865
00:46:54,258 --> 00:46:55,530
Sand told me

866
00:46:55,901 --> 00:46:57,803
that everyone else has moved on

867
00:47:01,837 --> 00:47:03,433
and I'm the only one stuck in the same place.

868
00:47:06,181 --> 00:47:07,445
But what can I do?

869
00:47:10,062 --> 00:47:11,627
I still can't move forward.

870
00:47:35,435 --> 00:47:36,127
Arm,

871
00:47:37,915 --> 00:47:39,106
do you trust me?

872
00:47:46,469 --> 00:47:47,181
What do you say?

873
00:47:48,315 --> 00:47:49,686
Trust you with what?

874
00:47:50,755 --> 00:47:51,899
Breaking the curse.

875
00:47:55,017 --> 00:47:56,536
I'll lead you forward.

876
00:48:11,650 --> 00:48:12,228
Is that okay?

877
00:48:47,623 --> 00:48:48,440
I'm going to kiss you, okay?

878
00:48:50,119 --> 00:48:52,893
Are you asking for permission,
or just telling me what you're going to do?

879
00:49:12,896 --> 00:49:13,844
Do you trust me?

880
00:49:14,803 --> 00:49:16,142
Trust you with what?

881
00:49:16,142 --> 00:49:16,851
Arm.

882
00:49:18,072 --> 00:49:18,857
Yes,

883
00:49:20,471 --> 00:49:21,869
I trust you with everything.

Your group bracelet.

00:50:21,234 --> 00:50:22,066
It's mine.

Well, you didn't tell me.

00:50:39,851 --> 00:50:41,083
You're not speaking politely.

900
00:50:53,271 --> 00:50:54,514
I didn't say anything.

901
00:50:56,804 --> 00:50:58,462
I just wanted to kiss you.

902
00:51:01,079 --> 00:51:02,443
You're so demanding.

00:51:11,695 --> 00:51:15,238
you said you won't love anyone else again,

906
00:51:16,001 --> 00:51:17,097
but now,

907
00:51:18,275 --> 00:51:22,014
you're not stopping anyone from loving you, right?

908
00:51:25,372 --> 00:51:28,721
I'm not sure.

909
00:51:29,680 --> 00:51:30,392
It's okay.

00:52:03,645 --> 00:52:05,515
I don't have an answer for you now.

920
00:52:05,755 --> 00:52:06,558
I like you.

921
00:52:06,558 --> 00:52:07,102
Huh?

922
00:52:09,719 --> 00:52:10,420
Who are you leaving with?

923
00:52:10,420 --> 00:52:12,790
Arc's condo!

924
00:52:12,790 --> 00:52:14,183
I'm leaving with Arc!

How did you know my class was here?

926
00:52:15,604 --> 00:52:16,406
I pay attention.

927
00:52:16,406 --> 00:52:17,211
Isn't that too much?

928
00:52:17,211 --> 00:52:17,939
I know, right?

929
00:52:18,135 --> 00:52:19,838
Being taken care of like this by you

930
00:52:20,405 --> 00:52:21,072
feels good.

931
00:52:21,377 --> 00:52:22,521
What are you doing here?

932
00:52:22,674 --> 00:52:23,174
Oh.

933
00:52:23,217 --> 00:52:24,652
Pond is here to hit on Sand.

934
00:52:24,848 --> 00:52:27,332
I'm glad you're jealous.

935
00:52:28,161 --> 00:52:29,044
I like it.
