Oh, shit!

5
00:00:18,896 --> 00:00:20,280
Why did you go out in the rain and get soaked?

6
00:00:20,280 --> 00:00:22,110
Do we know each other?

7
00:00:22,233 --> 00:00:23,981
Just say you're worried about him.

8
00:00:24,253 --> 00:00:25,942
Why are you being so tight-lipped?

9
00:00:26,905 --> 00:00:28,084
Take my car.

10
00:00:28,207 --> 00:00:29,870
I have a class at 8:40 a.m. tomorrow.

11
00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:30,946
Come pick me up.

12
00:00:32,279 --> 00:00:33,018
Arc!

13
00:00:37,720 --> 00:00:38,513
I'm sorry.

14
00:00:40,389 --> 00:00:41,314
From now on,

15
00:00:42,104 --> 00:00:43,502
I'll take the best care of you.

16
00:00:53,153 --> 00:00:54,400
When I got into that accident,

17
00:00:54,400 --> 00:00:56,290
I was in shock.

18
00:00:56,290 --> 00:00:57,062
Like this.

19
00:00:57,062 --> 00:00:59,368
Honestly, you had some guts, Arc.

20
00:00:59,368 --> 00:01:01,877
I can't believe you crashed into another car like that.

21
00:01:01,877 --> 00:01:03,035
I'd never do that.

22
00:01:03,035 --> 00:01:03,724
I love my car too much.

23
00:01:03,724 --> 00:01:04,575
Come on.

24
00:01:04,921 --> 00:01:06,468
He has four cars at home.

25
00:01:06,468 --> 00:01:08,192
He can use any of them while one's being repaired.

26
00:01:08,365 --> 00:01:09,199
Really?

27
00:01:09,199 --> 00:01:10,857
Jet, you're exaggerating.

28
00:01:12,000 --> 00:01:13,857
Since that day,

29
00:01:13,980 --> 00:01:16,264
Arc has never changed his car again.

30
00:01:16,387 --> 00:01:18,733
And he's become so calm.

31
00:01:18,733 --> 00:01:21,195
No more speeding, let alone honking the horn.

32
00:01:22,207 --> 00:01:24,245
You're worried about me, right?

33
00:01:24,245 --> 00:01:26,285
Right?

34
00:01:30,679 --> 00:01:31,362
You're drunk.

35
00:01:31,485 --> 00:01:32,548
You should go home.

36
00:01:35,090 --> 00:01:37,441
You always run away when you're shy.

37
00:01:37,680 --> 00:01:39,419
Just say you love me.

38
00:01:39,419 --> 00:01:41,142
I always tell you I love you.

39
00:01:41,142 --> 00:01:42,817
Love you, Arc.

40
00:01:43,558 --> 00:01:46,349
This cute guy is mine.

41
00:01:47,484 --> 00:01:49,233
Let me rub my face against yours.

42
00:01:55,108 --> 00:01:56,086
He's not okay.

43
00:01:56,382 --> 00:01:57,621
I'm leaving, guys.

44
00:01:57,621 --> 00:01:58,520
Enjoy.

45
00:01:58,841 --> 00:01:59,440
Let's go.

46
00:01:59,440 --> 00:02:00,313
Safe trip home.

47
00:02:00,412 --> 00:02:01,307
Bye.

48
00:02:01,307 --> 00:02:02,076
Bye, Arc. Bye, Arm.

49
00:02:02,076 --> 00:02:02,870
Are we leaving already?

50
00:02:03,759 --> 00:02:04,674
Bye, guys.

51
00:02:04,674 --> 00:02:05,734
- Bye.
- Bye.

52
00:02:05,734 --> 00:02:06,534
- Bye. Safe trip home.
- We have to go.

53
00:02:06,534 --> 00:02:07,083
- Safe trip home.
- See you.

54
00:02:07,083 --> 00:02:08,043
Enjoy.

55
00:02:08,142 --> 00:02:09,480
I'll split the bill and let you know.

56
00:02:09,480 --> 00:02:10,074
Okay.

57
00:02:10,074 --> 00:02:11,447
Shall we leave too?

58
00:02:11,570 --> 00:02:12,641
The bar is almost closing.

59
00:02:13,406 --> 00:02:14,254
Anything works for me.

60
00:02:14,772 --> 00:02:15,912
Do you want to leave yet, Yeepun?

61
00:02:16,258 --> 00:02:17,375
Let's go, babe.

62
00:02:17,375 --> 00:02:19,612
See you next time, guys.

63
00:02:19,612 --> 00:02:20,556
Today was so much fun.

64
00:02:21,050 --> 00:02:22,081
See you, everyone.

65
00:02:22,081 --> 00:02:24,193
Bye, Jet. Bye, Pun.

66
00:02:26,361 --> 00:02:26,909
Let's go.

67
00:02:27,501 --> 00:02:28,309
Bye.

68
00:02:28,309 --> 00:02:29,268
Bye, guys.

69
00:02:29,268 --> 00:02:30,026
Bye.

70
00:02:32,272 --> 00:02:33,519
Shall we go?

71
00:02:34,383 --> 00:02:35,000
Yes.

72
00:02:35,420 --> 00:02:37,974
But I want to buy fried chicken with sticky rice
on our way back.

73
00:02:38,937 --> 00:02:40,043
I'm hungry.

74
00:02:40,487 --> 00:02:41,263
Of course.

75
00:02:45,163 --> 00:02:47,647
By the way, freshmen live in the on-campus dorm, right?

76
00:02:47,647 --> 00:02:48,378
I'll give you a ride.

77
00:02:48,378 --> 00:02:48,987
No need.

78
00:02:49,560 --> 00:02:50,322
I'm passing the on-campus dorm.

79
00:02:50,322 --> 00:02:51,264
I'll give him a ride.

80
00:02:51,832 --> 00:02:52,544
Excuse me.

81
00:02:52,939 --> 00:02:54,540
Wine is my peer mentee.

82
00:02:54,737 --> 00:02:55,792
You're sticking your nose in.

83
00:02:55,940 --> 00:02:56,928
Come on.

84
00:02:57,125 --> 00:02:59,889
You guys leave in pairs.

85
00:02:59,889 --> 00:03:01,210
Do you want me to leave alone?

86
00:03:01,383 --> 00:03:02,993
You know I don't like leaving alone.

87
00:03:02,993 --> 00:03:03,879
I'm lonely.

88
00:03:05,237 --> 00:03:07,209
Can I borrow your peer mentee for a day?

89
00:03:07,209 --> 00:03:09,282
Please. Can I?

90
00:03:11,874 --> 00:03:13,640
Well, I can go with Faifa.

91
00:03:14,529 --> 00:03:15,326
You're the cutest.

92
00:03:15,326 --> 00:03:16,262
Let me kiss you on the forehead.

93
00:03:16,262 --> 00:03:16,762
Ouch!

94
00:03:16,762 --> 00:03:17,559
What?

95
00:03:17,559 --> 00:03:18,165
Fai!

96
00:03:18,412 --> 00:03:18,961
What?

97
00:03:18,961 --> 00:03:21,076
I told you Wine is my peer mentee.

98
00:03:21,076 --> 00:03:24,538
He's not someone you can mess with.

99
00:03:24,538 --> 00:03:25,745
Calm down.

100
00:03:26,436 --> 00:03:30,180
I promise I won't treat him
the way I did the others.

101
00:03:31,167 --> 00:03:32,124
What do you mean?

102
00:03:32,914 --> 00:03:34,248
He's not like anyone else.

103
00:03:36,272 --> 00:03:37,229
Right, Wine?

104
00:03:42,980 --> 00:03:44,242
BANG ON POCHANA

105
00:03:44,242 --> 00:03:45,155
I'm fine.

106
00:03:45,254 --> 00:03:47,642
I haven't even asked.

107
00:03:49,400 --> 00:03:50,402
Our ride is almost here.

108
00:03:50,970 --> 00:03:51,735
Are you sleepy?

109
00:03:53,315 --> 00:03:54,098
A little bit.

110
00:03:54,913 --> 00:03:57,148
Hey, you have class early tomorrow morning.

111
00:03:57,444 --> 00:03:58,498
Will you be able to wake up?

112
00:04:00,695 --> 00:04:01,547
It's okay.

113
00:04:01,868 --> 00:04:02,909
My boyfriend can wake me up.

114
00:04:24,477 --> 00:04:25,284
Are you sober now?

115
00:04:26,444 --> 00:04:27,138
Yes, I am.

116
00:04:34,970 --> 00:04:36,877
How are we getting home?

117
00:04:37,914 --> 00:04:39,452
Driving, of course.

118
00:04:40,044 --> 00:04:41,060
But you were drinking.

119
00:04:41,060 --> 00:04:41,957
How can you drive now?

120
00:04:42,599 --> 00:04:44,165
Come on, it's fine.
I only had a little.

121
00:04:45,078 --> 00:04:46,145
It's against the law.

122
00:04:47,206 --> 00:04:50,654
Then I'll need your help.

123
00:04:51,049 --> 00:04:51,980
I can't.

124
00:04:52,202 --> 00:04:53,225
I drank too.

125
00:04:54,163 --> 00:04:56,431
Besides, I can't drive.

126
00:04:57,097 --> 00:05:02,138
What I mean is, I'll need you to sit with me
until my blood alcohol level drops.

127
00:05:05,026 --> 00:05:05,759
Is that okay?

128
00:05:06,773 --> 00:05:07,355
Yeah.

129
00:05:25,625 --> 00:05:28,005
We're here to wait for your blood alcohol level to drop,

130
00:05:28,153 --> 00:05:29,209
not to eat.

131
00:05:29,555 --> 00:05:30,744
No need to rush.

132
00:05:32,817 --> 00:05:33,549
I forgot.

133
00:05:34,783 --> 00:05:35,794
The food is good.

134
00:05:36,263 --> 00:05:37,073
Aren't you going to eat?

135
00:05:37,468 --> 00:05:39,093
Do you always drink and drive?

136
00:05:39,636 --> 00:05:40,373
Sometimes.

137
00:05:41,854 --> 00:05:42,910
It's dangerous

138
00:05:43,576 --> 00:05:46,833
both to yourself and others on the road.

139
00:05:47,327 --> 00:05:48,228
You're so strict.

140
00:05:48,228 --> 00:05:48,937
I'm not scolding you,

141
00:05:49,727 --> 00:05:50,909
just explaining.

142
00:05:55,549 --> 00:05:58,621
I promise that from now on,
if I drink, I'll never drive

143
00:05:58,621 --> 00:06:00,643
because I don't want Master Wine to worry about me.

144
00:06:00,643 --> 00:06:01,472
Sir.

145
00:06:02,558 --> 00:06:03,233
Is that okay?

146
00:06:13,137 --> 00:06:14,636
You look like you want to talk to me about something.

147
00:06:16,068 --> 00:06:16,913
Are you uncomfortable?

148
00:06:17,308 --> 00:06:17,972
Huh?

149
00:06:18,564 --> 00:06:21,426
Are you uncomfortable with me bothering you?

150
00:06:22,018 --> 00:06:22,692
No.

151
00:06:24,000 --> 00:06:24,647
Really?

152
00:06:26,844 --> 00:06:28,146
That's a relief.

153
00:06:31,700 --> 00:06:33,670
Why would you think I'm uncomfortable?

154
00:06:34,460 --> 00:06:37,094
Because Yotha is so possessive of you.

155
00:06:37,094 --> 00:06:38,665
Look at what he said to me.

156
00:06:38,838 --> 00:06:40,054
I'm starting to believe it.

157
00:06:40,054 --> 00:06:41,867
Why are you worried I'll be uncomfortable?

158
00:06:42,583 --> 00:06:46,922
Because I always see you looking sleepy, lonely, and down.

159
00:06:47,366 --> 00:06:49,188
I just want you to have fun when you're with me.

160
00:06:50,003 --> 00:06:51,472
Do I make you feel that way?

161
00:06:51,669 --> 00:06:52,341
Yes.

162
00:06:54,389 --> 00:06:55,987
There's one more thing I want to ask you.

163
00:06:57,246 --> 00:06:58,011
What is it?

164
00:06:59,369 --> 00:07:00,133
Is something wrong?

165
00:07:01,170 --> 00:07:02,266
Why do you ask?

166
00:07:02,883 --> 00:07:04,954
Because you used to be more cheerful.

167
00:07:12,458 --> 00:07:14,351
Lately, you've been looking sad,

168
00:07:14,721 --> 00:07:16,945
like you have something on your mind.

169
00:07:19,981 --> 00:07:22,476
Can you read people's minds?

170
00:07:24,278 --> 00:07:27,168
So I'm right, aren't I?

171
00:07:29,636 --> 00:07:30,731
I knew it.

172
00:07:31,101 --> 00:07:32,345
I should've bought lottery tickets.

173
00:07:32,345 --> 00:07:33,208
I would've won.

174
00:07:42,588 --> 00:07:43,917
Hey. Lie down properly.

175
00:07:52,457 --> 00:07:53,737
Do you want to sleep now or take a shower first?

176
00:07:54,354 --> 00:07:56,366
Come on. Why do you ask?

177
00:07:56,366 --> 00:07:57,554
You already know the answer.

178
00:07:58,887 --> 00:07:59,895
You're dirty.

179
00:08:00,487 --> 00:08:01,735
Dirty?

180
00:08:05,857 --> 00:08:07,524
Do you love me when I'm dirty?

181
00:08:10,264 --> 00:08:11,225
Of course, I love you.

182
00:08:26,520 --> 00:08:29,013
Hey. What's with the lovey-dovey act?

183
00:08:29,161 --> 00:08:30,702
Can you continue telling me the story?

184
00:08:31,714 --> 00:08:32,445
What story?

185
00:08:33,013 --> 00:08:34,664
Our story.

186
00:08:34,664 --> 00:08:36,192
You haven't finished telling it.

187
00:08:36,192 --> 00:08:37,537
Can you continue?

188
00:08:38,919 --> 00:08:40,453
You already know the whole story.

189
00:08:41,194 --> 00:08:42,889
I want to hear it often.

190
00:08:42,889 --> 00:08:45,239
I want to hear why you love me again.

191
00:08:45,535 --> 00:08:47,026
Please.

192
00:08:48,704 --> 00:08:50,169
Please.

193
00:08:53,378 --> 00:08:54,804
Please.

194
00:08:54,804 --> 00:08:55,717
Can you tell me again?

195
00:10:36,000 --> 00:10:37,649
You're not hurt anymore, right?

196
00:10:38,192 --> 00:10:40,059
No, it's only a little scratch.

197
00:10:40,405 --> 00:10:41,784
At the time of the accident,

198
00:10:41,784 --> 00:10:43,169
I was so shocked.

199
00:10:44,872 --> 00:10:46,051
When Arc called,

200
00:10:46,051 --> 00:10:47,733
I was so shocked, too.

201
00:10:48,301 --> 00:10:50,164
Luckily, none of you got badly hurt.

202
00:10:52,805 --> 00:10:53,594
But Arc,

203
00:10:54,680 --> 00:10:56,686
you can't keep doing things like that.

204
00:10:57,303 --> 00:11:00,131
It's dangerous for both you and Arm.

205
00:11:00,452 --> 00:11:01,853
If something happened to him,

206
00:11:02,480 --> 00:11:03,396
who would take responsibility?

207
00:11:09,123 --> 00:11:10,727
Not to mention the other party.

208
00:11:11,640 --> 00:11:13,164
We're talking about someone's life.

209
00:11:15,904 --> 00:11:17,810
No matter how much money you have,

210
00:11:18,360 --> 00:11:19,641
you can't make up for that.

211
00:11:28,813 --> 00:11:29,986
I'm sorry, Jet.

212
00:11:38,546 --> 00:11:39,360
Alright.

213
00:11:39,557 --> 00:11:41,930
Since no one got really hurt,

214
00:11:42,226 --> 00:11:43,680
let's stop talking about it.

215
00:11:43,800 --> 00:11:44,341
Yeah.

216
00:11:44,341 --> 00:11:44,891
Okay?

217
00:11:45,261 --> 00:11:46,066
Let's eat.

218
00:11:47,053 --> 00:11:48,181
I'm going to the restroom.

219
00:11:57,399 --> 00:11:59,275
Is something wrong with Arc?

220
00:11:59,843 --> 00:12:00,808
I don't know.

221
00:12:00,956 --> 00:12:01,978
I've never seen him like this.

222
00:12:02,560 --> 00:12:04,953
This time, it's really serious for him.

223
00:12:05,323 --> 00:12:06,559
He risked Arm's life too.

224
00:12:08,583 --> 00:12:09,083
Me?

225
00:12:23,073 --> 00:12:24,047
Hello.

226
00:12:27,601 --> 00:12:28,248
What is it?

227
00:12:30,519 --> 00:12:31,814
Pun is going to order desserts.

228
00:12:31,814 --> 00:12:32,559
Do you want anything?

229
00:12:33,176 --> 00:12:34,429
Can you leave me alone for a while?

230
00:12:34,725 --> 00:12:35,478
No.

231
00:12:36,243 --> 00:12:36,883
Arm.

232
00:12:40,000 --> 00:12:44,440
Honestly, I'm mad at you for being hot-headed.

233
00:12:45,279 --> 00:12:46,843
It was really dangerous, you know?

234
00:12:47,238 --> 00:12:49,396
You usually get hot-headed
and do something like that, right?

235
00:12:49,593 --> 00:12:52,885
But this time, you're feeling bad because I was with you.

236
00:12:52,885 --> 00:12:53,477
Am I right?

237
00:13:03,807 --> 00:13:07,284
I'm glad you feel guilty,

238
00:13:07,531 --> 00:13:08,820
but that's not completely right.

239
00:13:08,968 --> 00:13:09,992
What are you saying?

240
00:13:10,387 --> 00:13:13,619
You shouldn't feel guilty
just because you're worried about someone else.

241
00:13:14,162 --> 00:13:18,064
You should know there are people who worry about you, too.

242
00:13:21,051 --> 00:13:22,575
You're worried about me.

243
00:13:23,044 --> 00:13:24,714
I'm worried about you, too.

244
00:13:25,232 --> 00:13:26,107
Got it?

245
00:13:30,155 --> 00:13:31,597
Do you understand?

246
00:13:32,436 --> 00:13:33,109
Yeah.

247
00:13:33,109 --> 00:13:34,019
Come on.

248
00:13:34,389 --> 00:13:36,387
If you understand, you should nod.

249
00:13:36,387 --> 00:13:37,493
Like this.

250
00:13:37,913 --> 00:13:38,838
Don't mess with my head.

251
00:13:39,011 --> 00:13:39,905
I'm your senior.

252
00:13:40,201 --> 00:13:42,432
Oh, I forgot my place.

253
00:13:43,123 --> 00:13:45,449
Let's go eat some desserts.

254
00:13:45,449 --> 00:13:46,666
I want to eat ice cream already.

255
00:13:46,839 --> 00:13:48,539
This meal is on you, okay?

256
00:13:48,786 --> 00:13:50,098
Consider it your way of compensating me.

257
00:13:50,641 --> 00:13:51,246
Let's go.

258
00:13:55,072 --> 00:13:57,339
Jet will give you a ride.

259
00:13:57,536 --> 00:13:58,403
Both of you.

260
00:13:58,971 --> 00:13:59,647
It's okay.

261
00:14:00,000 --> 00:14:01,406
My family already brought me another car.

262
00:14:02,270 --> 00:14:02,915
Alright.

263
00:14:03,088 --> 00:14:04,185
Safe drive, then.

264
00:14:04,851 --> 00:14:07,295
Are you going with Arc?

265
00:14:07,887 --> 00:14:09,247
Do you still dare to ride in his car?

266
00:14:11,419 --> 00:14:12,896
We can split here.

267
00:14:13,168 --> 00:14:14,308
Arm can go with Jet.

268
00:14:17,542 --> 00:14:18,361
It's fine.

269
00:14:18,781 --> 00:14:20,650
I want to sit in every one of Arc's cars.

270
00:14:21,267 --> 00:14:22,810
This one looks beautiful.

271
00:14:23,156 --> 00:14:24,300
The seats should be soft.

272
00:14:28,891 --> 00:14:29,660
I'm leaving now.

273
00:14:29,660 --> 00:14:30,348
Bye, Pun.

274
00:14:30,348 --> 00:14:31,146
- Bye, Jet.
- Bye.

275
00:14:31,146 --> 00:14:31,646
Okay.

276
00:14:31,646 --> 00:14:32,734
Safe trip home.

277
00:14:33,006 --> 00:14:33,608
Bye.

278
00:14:36,000 --> 00:14:36,617
Come on.

279
00:14:39,776 --> 00:14:42,302
Arm is cute,
don't you think?

280
00:14:48,474 --> 00:14:50,287
Wow.

281
00:14:51,863 --> 00:14:53,141
This car is brand new.

282
00:15:00,645 --> 00:15:03,298
Wow.

283
00:15:04,433 --> 00:15:06,023
It's so high-tech.

284
00:15:08,220 --> 00:15:09,149
Can we turn on some music?

285
00:15:09,470 --> 00:15:10,228
Sure.

286
00:15:12,672 --> 00:15:13,767
Here we go.

287
00:15:15,865 --> 00:15:16,850
Aren't you scared anymore?

288
00:15:18,208 --> 00:15:18,802
No.

289
00:15:19,394 --> 00:15:22,455
You said you wouldn't hurt me again, didn't you?

290
00:15:24,997 --> 00:15:25,779
Besides,

291
00:15:26,767 --> 00:15:29,344
this car looks safe.

292
00:15:33,368 --> 00:15:34,278
Sit still.

293
00:15:36,444 --> 00:15:41,561
♪ I can only love you secretly ♪

294
00:16:00,987 --> 00:16:01,849
Good boy.

295
00:16:10,735 --> 00:16:11,666
Ahem.

296
00:16:12,580 --> 00:16:14,614
I saw you secretly smiling.

297
00:16:16,490 --> 00:16:17,585
Mind your own business.

298
00:16:30,861 --> 00:16:32,172
Arm is really something.

299
00:16:32,295 --> 00:16:33,969
He managed to throw Arc off balance.

300
00:16:36,000 --> 00:16:37,565
Just like when I met you.

301
00:16:38,947 --> 00:16:40,933
I hung up my fangs and claws

302
00:16:41,377 --> 00:16:43,144
and became a kitten.

303
00:16:43,144 --> 00:16:44,800
Arm is really cute.

304
00:16:45,146 --> 00:16:46,530
This is just the beginning.

305
00:16:47,024 --> 00:16:50,064
I think Arm can mess with Arc so much more.

306
00:16:55,198 --> 00:16:56,945
Thanks for the ride.

307
00:16:57,439 --> 00:16:58,118
Bye now.

308
00:17:02,758 --> 00:17:03,882
Hey, wait.

309
00:17:10,941 --> 00:17:12,287
I got you into an accident.

310
00:17:12,559 --> 00:17:14,239
You can scold me as much as you want.

311
00:17:16,609 --> 00:17:18,003
Wow.

312
00:17:19,237 --> 00:17:20,800
As much as I want?

313
00:17:24,000 --> 00:17:24,694
Hmm.

314
00:17:26,990 --> 00:17:28,079
I can't think of anything yet.

315
00:17:28,671 --> 00:17:30,043
Can I keep my quota?

316
00:17:31,796 --> 00:17:32,816
You're getting on my nerves.

317
00:17:33,080 --> 00:17:34,520
Come on, Arc.

318
00:17:35,038 --> 00:17:36,343
You said I could scold you,

319
00:17:36,590 --> 00:17:37,921
but you scolded me first.

320
00:17:39,106 --> 00:17:40,476
Hmm.

321
00:17:42,673 --> 00:17:43,412
I don't know.

322
00:17:43,412 --> 00:17:44,555
I can't think of anything.

323
00:17:44,555 --> 00:17:46,070
When I can, I'll scold you then.

324
00:17:46,465 --> 00:17:47,584
I have to go. Bye.

325
00:17:49,065 --> 00:17:50,599
Why didn't you go with Jet?

326
00:17:53,438 --> 00:17:54,773
Why did you jump into my car?

327
00:17:57,735 --> 00:17:58,525
Is that a problem?

328
00:18:03,412 --> 00:18:06,192
I thought you'd have had enough
and not dare to get into my car again.

329
00:18:09,426 --> 00:18:11,153
Well, I trust you now.

330
00:18:16,111 --> 00:18:16,776
Huh?

331
00:18:20,232 --> 00:18:22,720
You said you wouldn't hurt me again, didn't you?

332
00:18:26,398 --> 00:18:27,291
Aw.

333
00:18:28,451 --> 00:18:29,789
You're touched, right?

334
00:18:34,800 --> 00:18:35,520
Here.

335
00:18:36,779 --> 00:18:37,546
What?

336
00:18:38,978 --> 00:18:40,187
You can unblock yourself

337
00:18:40,187 --> 00:18:41,044
on every app.

338
00:18:41,439 --> 00:18:42,443
Every app?

339
00:18:43,430 --> 00:18:44,326
That's great.

340
00:18:53,877 --> 00:18:55,100
Do you really mean every app?

341
00:18:55,520 --> 00:18:56,431
Yeah.

342
00:18:59,022 --> 00:18:59,737
Give it back.

343
00:18:59,737 --> 00:19:01,038
No.

344
00:19:11,582 --> 00:19:12,378
Ah.

345
00:19:12,811 --> 00:19:13,888
It's so cool in here.

346
00:19:19,116 --> 00:19:20,456
Oh, you're here, Po.

347
00:19:21,988 --> 00:19:22,631
Where's Sand?

348
00:19:23,713 --> 00:19:26,274
He's been gone since the afternoon.

349
00:19:26,653 --> 00:19:27,673
I don't know what he's doing.

350
00:19:30,612 --> 00:19:31,936
I'm so tired.

351
00:19:32,603 --> 00:19:34,317
Was the movie fun?

352
00:19:34,680 --> 00:19:35,956
Fun, my ass.

353
00:19:36,082 --> 00:19:37,072
I didn't watch it.

354
00:19:38,479 --> 00:19:39,147
Why not?

355
00:19:40,679 --> 00:19:41,580
It's a long story.

356
00:19:41,796 --> 00:19:42,579
I'll tell you later.

357
00:19:43,516 --> 00:19:44,417
It's a long story, huh?

358
00:19:44,760 --> 00:19:45,873
I better take a shower.

359
00:19:51,930 --> 00:19:52,588
Damn it!

360
00:19:55,977 --> 00:19:56,950
What's wrong?

361
00:19:58,338 --> 00:19:59,473
What happened?

362
00:19:59,761 --> 00:20:01,093
A cat scratched me.

363
00:20:01,454 --> 00:20:02,883
Or a girl.

364
00:20:03,207 --> 00:20:04,361
It's my business.

365
00:20:04,400 --> 00:20:06,596
Wow, you're really something.

366
00:20:08,561 --> 00:20:09,125
Whoa.

367
00:20:09,882 --> 00:20:10,452
Shit.

368
00:20:19,051 --> 00:20:19,919
I'm going to take a shower.

369
00:20:20,766 --> 00:20:21,501
Hey.

370
00:20:21,699 --> 00:20:22,420
What?

371
00:20:22,420 --> 00:20:23,323
What are you doing?

372
00:20:23,467 --> 00:20:24,423
It's a long story.

373
00:20:24,423 --> 00:20:25,339
You got me.

374
00:20:25,339 --> 00:20:26,111
Yes, I did.

375
00:20:29,140 --> 00:20:29,841
What's wrong with you?

376
00:20:33,410 --> 00:20:34,203
Electric shock?

377
00:20:34,203 --> 00:20:35,771
Electric shock, then what?

378
00:20:37,664 --> 00:20:38,259
Die.

379
00:20:38,259 --> 00:20:38,841
Yes.

380
00:20:38,841 --> 00:20:39,373
Correct.

381
00:20:41,500 --> 00:20:42,092
Hey.

382
00:20:43,967 --> 00:20:45,363
Hi, Arc.

383
00:20:48,320 --> 00:20:49,057
What are you doing here?

384
00:20:50,211 --> 00:20:51,379
I invited him,

385
00:20:51,812 --> 00:20:53,488
since you stole his roommate this morning.

386
00:20:54,389 --> 00:20:55,928
I didn't want him to feel lonely, so I asked him to come along.

387
00:20:58,091 --> 00:20:58,867
I was just asking,

388
00:20:58,975 --> 00:20:59,666
not complaining.

389
00:21:01,577 --> 00:21:02,258
Let's talk about you.

390
00:21:03,502 --> 00:21:04,457
Where did you get in trouble?

391
00:21:06,224 --> 00:21:07,638
Who spread the news to you?

392
00:21:07,638 --> 00:21:08,150
Huh?

393
00:21:08,853 --> 00:21:10,319
Your mom called me.

394
00:21:10,445 --> 00:21:11,570
No one spread it.

395
00:21:12,489 --> 00:21:13,152
My mom?

396
00:21:13,567 --> 00:21:16,783
Yeah, she called, asking me to take care of you

397
00:21:16,999 --> 00:21:18,968
and warn you about your driving.

398
00:21:19,941 --> 00:21:21,623
Old habits die hard, huh?

399
00:21:21,785 --> 00:21:22,921
Be careful when you drive.

400
00:21:22,921 --> 00:21:25,295
This time, you hurt a junior.

401
00:21:28,215 --> 00:21:28,949
Oh.

402
00:21:29,075 --> 00:21:30,703
Is it the scratch Arm posted on his story?

403
00:21:34,020 --> 00:21:34,714
What story?

404
00:21:38,410 --> 00:21:39,018
Here.

405
00:21:52,680 --> 00:21:53,356
Arm!

406
00:21:54,023 --> 00:21:55,171
Someone's calling you!

407
00:21:55,405 --> 00:21:57,400
Just decline it!

408
00:21:57,400 --> 00:21:58,708
I'm in the shower!

409
00:22:02,746 --> 00:22:03,885
Oh, shit!

410
00:22:04,985 --> 00:22:05,596
Arm!

411
00:22:06,768 --> 00:22:07,376
What?

412
00:22:07,683 --> 00:22:08,753
It's Arc.

413
00:22:09,132 --> 00:22:09,690
Shit!

414
00:22:10,285 --> 00:22:11,503
Give me a second!

415
00:22:12,368 --> 00:22:12,942
Where?

416
00:22:13,663 --> 00:22:14,243
Here.

417
00:22:14,549 --> 00:22:15,608
Oh, shit.

418
00:22:16,059 --> 00:22:18,164
Why are you naked?

419
00:22:18,507 --> 00:22:20,685
Come on. Don't be shy.

420
00:22:20,775 --> 00:22:22,343
You've seen me since kindergarten.

421
00:22:22,343 --> 00:22:24,220
That was when you were a kid.

422
00:22:24,508 --> 00:22:25,942
You're a grownup now.

423
00:22:25,942 --> 00:22:26,999
You might not be embarrassed

424
00:22:26,999 --> 00:22:27,966
but I'm going to vomit.

425
00:22:28,092 --> 00:22:29,184
I'm still as cute as ever.

426
00:22:29,292 --> 00:22:30,688
It's still as small as ever.

427
00:22:30,688 --> 00:22:31,741
As if yours are so much bigger than mine.

428
00:22:31,813 --> 00:22:32,824
Come on.

429
00:22:32,824 --> 00:22:33,972
I almost got blind.

430
00:22:35,288 --> 00:22:36,083
Hello?

431
00:22:36,751 --> 00:22:38,314
You might as well post naked on your IG.

432
00:22:41,087 --> 00:22:41,999
Why are you mad?

433
00:22:42,233 --> 00:22:43,885
He's just his peer mentor's mentor

434
00:22:44,040 --> 00:22:45,199
but he's possessive of him.

435
00:22:49,075 --> 00:22:49,792
He's gone.

436
00:22:50,838 --> 00:22:51,520
Hello?

437
00:22:52,115 --> 00:22:53,742
Hello? Are you still there?

438
00:22:54,986 --> 00:22:56,123
Why did you take a photo shirtless?

439
00:22:58,881 --> 00:23:00,580
Only my shoulder can be seen.

440
00:23:00,720 --> 00:23:02,190
I didn't take off my shirt.

441
00:23:02,605 --> 00:23:03,718
I can tell that you did.

442
00:23:03,988 --> 00:23:05,407
So what if I did?

443
00:23:06,360 --> 00:23:07,302
Are you possessive of me?

444
00:23:08,961 --> 00:23:10,121
Don't flatter yourself.

445
00:23:10,283 --> 00:23:11,057
Delete it now.

446
00:23:11,544 --> 00:23:12,632
Fine.

447
00:23:12,956 --> 00:23:14,756
If I delete my story, you'll be happy, right?

448
00:23:15,639 --> 00:23:16,189
Yeah.

449
00:23:16,820 --> 00:23:20,564
Only when you have half as many six-packs as I do,
can you think about showing them off.

450
00:23:21,844 --> 00:23:23,614
You have a big belly. It's embarrassing.

451
00:23:26,895 --> 00:23:27,833
Fine.

452
00:23:28,717 --> 00:23:29,888
You want to be like this?

453
00:23:49,677 --> 00:23:50,942
Fine.

454
00:23:51,230 --> 00:23:52,386
You want to be like this?

455
00:23:52,386 --> 00:23:54,501
DON'T FORGET TO APPLY YOUR MEDICINE.

456
00:23:58,756 --> 00:24:00,196
I feel so comfortable!

457
00:24:04,324 --> 00:24:05,487
Have you seen Arc's comment?

458
00:24:06,497 --> 00:24:07,119
What did he say?

459
00:24:08,129 --> 00:24:09,325
I bet he's furious with me.

460
00:24:10,046 --> 00:24:11,304
I'm so satisfied.

461
00:24:11,304 --> 00:24:12,139
I got back at him.

462
00:24:12,590 --> 00:24:13,449
Have a look.

463
00:24:15,973 --> 00:24:16,661
What?

464
00:24:20,717 --> 00:24:22,021
DON'T FORGET TO APPLY YOUR MEDICINE.

465
00:24:26,041 --> 00:24:27,363
He's definitely trying to get on my nerves.

466
00:24:27,440 --> 00:24:28,819
He's definitely trying to get on my nerves.

467
00:24:28,819 --> 00:24:29,435
Shit!

468
00:24:29,435 --> 00:24:30,086
Damn it!

469
00:24:31,862 --> 00:24:33,429
He's trying to get on my nerves.

470
00:24:33,800 --> 00:24:34,651
Damn it!

471
00:24:34,651 --> 00:24:37,586
Um, is this you looking satisfied?

472
00:24:37,586 --> 00:24:38,265
Shut up, Po!

473
00:24:38,265 --> 00:24:38,818
I'm going to sleep!

474
00:24:38,818 --> 00:24:40,788
Come on, the sun hasn't even set,

475
00:24:40,788 --> 00:24:42,058
but you're going to sleep already?

476
00:24:46,511 --> 00:24:47,594
I knew it.

477
00:24:51,686 --> 00:24:52,470
Hello?

478
00:24:53,119 --> 00:24:53,979
Why did you call me?

479
00:24:54,556 --> 00:24:55,466
You haven't replied to me.

480
00:24:56,241 --> 00:24:56,997
Have you applied your medicine?

481
00:24:58,151 --> 00:24:58,651
Yes!

482
00:24:59,282 --> 00:25:00,010
I already did!

483
00:25:00,497 --> 00:25:01,985
Okay. Bye.

484
00:25:07,249 --> 00:25:08,995
I lost!

485
00:25:11,140 --> 00:25:11,751
Hey.

486
00:25:12,112 --> 00:25:13,076
Who are you talking to?

487
00:25:13,707 --> 00:25:14,306
None of your business.

488
00:25:21,228 --> 00:25:22,553
Thank you for the ride

489
00:25:23,184 --> 00:25:24,719
and the meal.

490
00:25:25,296 --> 00:25:25,970
I'm so full.

491
00:25:30,999 --> 00:25:32,740
Do you like the restaurant?

492
00:25:33,101 --> 00:25:34,220
Very much.

493
00:25:34,418 --> 00:25:35,092
The food is so good.

494
00:25:35,524 --> 00:25:37,401
It's definitely the hidden gem you said it would be.

495
00:25:38,645 --> 00:25:41,075
Then I'll take you there often.

496
00:25:45,582 --> 00:25:46,291
I'm heading out now.

497
00:25:49,482 --> 00:25:51,035
Drive safe.

498
00:25:52,315 --> 00:25:52,897
Good night.

499
00:25:53,907 --> 00:25:54,662
Good night.

500
00:25:54,896 --> 00:25:55,490
See you.

501
00:25:57,653 --> 00:25:58,548
Safe trip home.

502
00:26:02,514 --> 00:26:03,525
Let me know when you get there.

503
00:26:03,525 --> 00:26:04,096
Bye.

504
00:26:17,034 --> 00:26:18,232
Hey, you're quiet.

505
00:26:19,278 --> 00:26:20,036
What's this?

506
00:26:20,234 --> 00:26:21,177
It's only 8 p.m. and you guys are sleeping already?

507
00:26:22,259 --> 00:26:24,736
I'm not, but your friend is having a sweet dream.

508
00:26:25,818 --> 00:26:27,594
What? His wound is so small.

509
00:26:27,955 --> 00:26:29,200
Why is he lying in bed like that?

510
00:26:29,536 --> 00:26:30,250
What a loser.

511
00:26:30,394 --> 00:26:31,644
The wound on his body might not be healed yet,

512
00:26:31,644 --> 00:26:33,135
but the one in his heart is fully healed.

513
00:26:34,794 --> 00:26:37,623
Does this mean you're avoiding me by sleeping?

514
00:26:37,623 --> 00:26:38,321
Hey, hey.

515
00:26:38,360 --> 00:26:39,498
Wake up, loser!

516
00:26:39,498 --> 00:26:40,768
He might actually be asleep.

517
00:26:40,768 --> 00:26:41,619
Don't bully him.

518
00:26:41,980 --> 00:26:42,919
You know what, Po?

519
00:26:43,352 --> 00:26:45,775
I have a way to prove if he's really asleep.

520
00:26:46,009 --> 00:26:47,526
If someone's really asleep

521
00:26:48,445 --> 00:26:50,480
and I make his hands form a heart shape like this,

522
00:26:51,360 --> 00:26:52,802
his hands will stay in the air.

523
00:26:57,579 --> 00:27:00,192
This means he's not asleep.

524
00:27:01,887 --> 00:27:03,098
Really, Arm?

525
00:27:04,126 --> 00:27:05,234
I want to sleep!

526
00:27:05,775 --> 00:27:07,149
You can't sleep!

527
00:27:07,833 --> 00:27:09,590
What's going on between you and Arc?

528
00:27:09,590 --> 00:27:10,728
Yeah, what's going on?

529
00:27:10,728 --> 00:27:11,590
Nothing!

530
00:27:11,590 --> 00:27:12,751
Nothing, huh?

531
00:27:12,751 --> 00:27:14,050
I want to sleep!

532
00:27:19,549 --> 00:27:21,268
Damn it, Po!

533
00:27:30,457 --> 00:27:32,892
Arc, Warm, I made you some snacks.

534
00:27:38,192 --> 00:27:39,009
Thank you.

535
00:27:40,650 --> 00:27:42,466
Wow, these look so good.

536
00:27:42,466 --> 00:27:43,616
Enjoy.

537
00:27:44,517 --> 00:27:46,019
Hey, I have to go.

538
00:27:46,578 --> 00:27:47,218
Okay.

539
00:27:47,434 --> 00:27:48,031
See you in class.

540
00:27:55,722 --> 00:27:56,542
Why aren't you in class?

541
00:27:56,542 --> 00:27:57,082
Oh, shit!

542
00:27:58,254 --> 00:27:59,085
You scared me.

543
00:28:05,359 --> 00:28:06,133
What are you waiting for?

544
00:28:07,359 --> 00:28:09,271
I'm waiting for Pun to bring me her calculus books.

545
00:28:13,580 --> 00:28:14,116
Here.

546
00:28:14,314 --> 00:28:14,888
Is it this one?

547
00:28:16,186 --> 00:28:17,183
Yes, it is.

548
00:28:18,409 --> 00:28:19,129
You have it too?

549
00:28:19,526 --> 00:28:20,406
It's Pun's.

550
00:28:20,767 --> 00:28:21,661
She asked me to give it to you.

551
00:28:23,680 --> 00:28:24,705
Why didn't you tell me that in the beginning?

552
00:28:29,140 --> 00:28:30,322
Aren't there supposed to be two books?

553
00:28:30,989 --> 00:28:31,535
Yeah.

554
00:28:31,859 --> 00:28:32,571
Where's the other one?

555
00:28:33,004 --> 00:28:34,549
Let me know when you finish this one

556
00:28:34,693 --> 00:28:35,705
and I'll bring you the other.

557
00:28:37,490 --> 00:28:39,399
Why didn't you bring me both at once?

558
00:28:41,148 --> 00:28:42,575
Why should I?

559
00:28:43,368 --> 00:28:44,553
To not waste time.

560
00:28:47,113 --> 00:28:48,099
But I want to waste time.

561
00:28:50,497 --> 00:28:51,828
Just let me know when you finish this one

562
00:28:52,152 --> 00:28:53,226
and I'll bring you the other.

563
00:28:53,947 --> 00:28:54,574
I'm going now.

564
00:28:55,223 --> 00:28:55,813
Where are you going?

565
00:29:02,970 --> 00:29:04,198
Stay out of my business for once.

566
00:29:12,177 --> 00:29:13,123
What's wrong with him?

567
00:29:19,178 --> 00:29:20,727
What's wrong with you, Po?

568
00:29:20,727 --> 00:29:22,042
You're the one sighing non-stop.

569
00:29:22,042 --> 00:29:23,101
Come on.

570
00:29:23,102 --> 00:29:23,602
Hey,

571
00:29:24,101 --> 00:29:24,861
I'm heading back.

572
00:29:30,855 --> 00:29:33,810
If you're lonely, just tell us,

573
00:29:33,810 --> 00:29:37,264
so we can keep you company in your room.

574
00:29:37,621 --> 00:29:38,322
There's no need.

575
00:29:39,178 --> 00:29:42,328
Oh, maybe you have someone waiting in the room.

576
00:29:42,530 --> 00:29:43,106
Yeah.

577
00:29:43,249 --> 00:29:44,058
No.

578
00:29:44,890 --> 00:29:47,256
Hey, why did you raise your voice?

579
00:29:47,256 --> 00:29:48,183
Hey, hey.

580
00:29:48,308 --> 00:29:49,812
You said you'd wait for us

581
00:29:50,044 --> 00:29:52,340
but your mentor's mentor always drops you off at the dorm.

582
00:29:52,750 --> 00:29:53,679
He's right.

583
00:29:53,679 --> 00:29:55,259
That's why I'm a little confused.

584
00:29:56,311 --> 00:29:57,195
Hey, Po.

585
00:29:57,730 --> 00:29:58,410
Listen to me.

586
00:29:58,410 --> 00:29:59,078
I'm listening.

587
00:29:59,078 --> 00:30:03,122
I'm going back to our room.

588
00:30:12,791 --> 00:30:13,559
I'll be right back.

589
00:30:19,481 --> 00:30:20,464
I'm thirsty.

590
00:30:24,890 --> 00:30:25,506
Here you go.

591
00:30:28,057 --> 00:30:29,051
I don't drink anyone else's stuff.

592
00:30:30,157 --> 00:30:31,094
It's not anyone else's.

593
00:30:31,451 --> 00:30:32,786
They bought it for you.

594
00:30:33,232 --> 00:30:36,466
I don't drink anything that anyone else buys for me.

595
00:30:40,087 --> 00:30:40,656
Fine.

596
00:30:41,887 --> 00:30:42,560
Give me a moment.

597
00:30:58,644 --> 00:30:59,384
Here you go.

598
00:31:00,775 --> 00:31:01,603
Open it for me.

599
00:31:06,187 --> 00:31:06,687
Here.

600
00:31:07,864 --> 00:31:08,594
Thanks.

601
00:31:09,111 --> 00:31:09,880
Save it.

602
00:31:10,005 --> 00:31:10,658
Arm!

603
00:31:17,960 --> 00:31:18,981
Can I go home now?

604
00:31:19,605 --> 00:31:20,416
I'll give you a ride.

605
00:31:23,199 --> 00:31:25,352
Oh, you don't have to.

606
00:31:27,207 --> 00:31:27,810
Why not?

607
00:31:31,663 --> 00:31:32,933
Why can't I give you a ride?

608
00:31:34,128 --> 00:31:37,265
No, I just don't want to trouble you.

609
00:31:39,013 --> 00:31:39,825
You don't want to trouble me?

610
00:31:42,322 --> 00:31:43,097
Give me the truth.

611
00:31:45,505 --> 00:31:47,188
Uh,

612
00:31:49,890 --> 00:31:51,156
I don't want my friends to tease me.

613
00:31:52,048 --> 00:31:53,846
Po and Sand are watching me.

614
00:31:55,773 --> 00:31:57,225
Why are they watching you?

615
00:31:59,562 --> 00:32:00,637
I don't know.

616
00:32:01,814 --> 00:32:02,556
What's wrong with you?

617
00:32:06,231 --> 00:32:06,936
Are you shy?

618
00:32:09,790 --> 00:32:10,772
It feels like you…

619
00:32:15,106 --> 00:32:16,410
I'm not shy.

620
00:32:17,052 --> 00:32:17,577
Okay?

621
00:32:22,340 --> 00:32:23,126
I'm almost done.

622
00:32:23,340 --> 00:32:24,391
Wait and let's leave together.

623
00:32:24,391 --> 00:32:25,101
Don't be stubborn.

624
00:32:35,466 --> 00:32:36,089
Shy?

625
00:32:36,410 --> 00:32:37,228
Am I shy?

626
00:32:38,280 --> 00:32:39,385
Shit, I'm not shy!

627
00:32:39,810 --> 00:32:40,599
That's crazy!

628
00:32:53,051 --> 00:32:54,739
The people who gave these to you would be so sad.

629
00:32:55,399 --> 00:32:56,472
I didn't ask them to.

630
00:32:57,774 --> 00:33:00,399
You're so mean.

631
00:33:04,555 --> 00:33:05,691
I really didn't ask them to.

632
00:33:05,923 --> 00:33:07,985
Besides, I don't like eating snacks.

633
00:33:07,985 --> 00:33:08,714
You know that.

634
00:33:09,356 --> 00:33:10,644
Why should I know that?

635
00:33:13,141 --> 00:33:14,701
Don't you want to get to know me at all?

636
00:33:14,969 --> 00:33:15,469
Huh?

637
00:33:20,927 --> 00:33:21,538
Get to know you?

638
00:33:23,036 --> 00:33:23,878
You're selfish.

639
00:33:25,287 --> 00:33:26,647
Hey, Arc!

640
00:33:27,057 --> 00:33:27,589
Shit!

641
00:33:29,319 --> 00:33:30,234
How am I selfish?

642
00:33:30,591 --> 00:33:31,864
I'm not selfish.

643
00:33:32,185 --> 00:33:33,025
You're selfish

644
00:33:33,507 --> 00:33:35,078
because I'm the only one trying to get to know you.

645
00:33:37,433 --> 00:33:38,046
What?

646
00:33:40,204 --> 00:33:41,335
When will you get it, Arm?

647
00:33:43,084 --> 00:33:43,927
Fine,

648
00:33:45,104 --> 00:33:46,495
I'll get to know you too.

649
00:33:47,084 --> 00:33:47,976
Get this into your head.

650
00:33:48,083 --> 00:33:49,626
I'm not selfish.

651
00:33:52,758 --> 00:33:53,934
Get to know him for what?

652
00:33:54,184 --> 00:33:55,250
What's wrong with him?

653
00:34:06,681 --> 00:34:07,661
Why did you bring me here?

654
00:34:08,178 --> 00:34:09,106
This is my favorite restaurant.

655
00:34:09,713 --> 00:34:10,290
So?

656
00:34:12,984 --> 00:34:13,491
Come on.

657
00:34:14,294 --> 00:34:16,090
You said you'd get to know me, didn't you?

658
00:34:16,536 --> 00:34:17,137
Oh, right.

659
00:34:17,262 --> 00:34:18,159
I forgot.

660
00:34:22,262 --> 00:34:22,818
Here.

661
00:34:23,424 --> 00:34:24,457
Order anything you want.

662
00:34:27,704 --> 00:34:28,307
No.

663
00:34:29,770 --> 00:34:30,697
What's wrong with you now?

664
00:34:32,195 --> 00:34:34,282
Well, you said I'm getting to know you today.

665
00:34:34,371 --> 00:34:35,262
So just order anything you like

666
00:34:35,262 --> 00:34:35,947
so I can remember it.

667
00:34:39,336 --> 00:34:39,884
Mm.

668
00:34:41,044 --> 00:34:41,580
Okay.

669
00:34:53,568 --> 00:34:54,068
Hey.

670
00:34:54,068 --> 00:34:54,568
Hmm?

671
00:34:54,568 --> 00:34:55,068
Should we leave now?

672
00:34:55,353 --> 00:34:56,045
Hold on.

673
00:34:56,687 --> 00:34:57,424
What are you waiting for?

674
00:34:57,424 --> 00:34:58,631
You didn't bring your motorbike, did you?

675
00:34:58,631 --> 00:34:59,557
Exactly.

676
00:35:00,395 --> 00:35:01,107
So,

677
00:35:04,496 --> 00:35:05,300
Get in the car.

678
00:35:05,746 --> 00:35:06,563
Pond will give us a ride.

679
00:35:08,490 --> 00:35:09,408
Hi, Pond.

680
00:35:09,408 --> 00:35:10,101
Hi.

681
00:35:10,957 --> 00:35:12,819
How should I feel about this?

682
00:35:13,622 --> 00:35:15,171
When did you guys make this plan?

683
00:35:19,791 --> 00:35:21,184
Wow.

684
00:35:22,468 --> 00:35:24,983
The crispy pork is so big.

685
00:35:26,035 --> 00:35:29,088
I just realized you like crispy pork too.

686
00:35:29,195 --> 00:35:29,935
I don't.

687
00:35:30,185 --> 00:35:30,685
Oh?

688
00:35:31,523 --> 00:35:32,475
Then why did you order it?

689
00:35:33,474 --> 00:35:34,640
Because I know you like it.

690
00:35:43,911 --> 00:35:44,851
It's your favorite.

691
00:35:45,226 --> 00:35:46,223
I remember that correctly, right?

692
00:35:51,949 --> 00:35:52,627
Yes.

693
00:35:53,572 --> 00:35:54,930
By the way, tomorrow is the pin-receiving ceremony.

694
00:35:54,930 --> 00:35:55,492
Are you joining?

695
00:35:55,884 --> 00:35:56,833
Why would I join?

696
00:35:57,190 --> 00:35:58,009
You're not getting one.

697
00:35:58,865 --> 00:36:00,742
I thought maybe you'd want to laugh at me

698
00:36:01,188 --> 00:36:02,670
for not joining the cheering activities

699
00:36:02,902 --> 00:36:04,164
and not getting my gear and pin.

700
00:36:04,396 --> 00:36:05,146
I'm so annoyed.

701
00:36:05,645 --> 00:36:06,463
It's just a pin.

702
00:36:06,463 --> 00:36:07,387
You can buy one yourself.

703
00:36:08,368 --> 00:36:09,603
Yeah, I guess so.

704
00:36:11,654 --> 00:36:13,008
You haven't answered me though.

705
00:36:15,149 --> 00:36:15,819
About what?

706
00:36:18,441 --> 00:36:19,124
Do you like this?

707
00:36:25,589 --> 00:36:26,291
What's your answer?

708
00:36:27,129 --> 00:36:27,832
Yeah.

709
00:36:29,508 --> 00:36:30,352
The food is tasty.

710
00:36:31,654 --> 00:36:32,245
Try it.

711
00:36:52,861 --> 00:36:53,485
Hey.

712
00:36:54,341 --> 00:36:55,827
The way you're staring at me like this…

713
00:36:55,827 --> 00:36:56,608
Who's staring at you?

714
00:36:56,697 --> 00:36:57,715
I'm not staring at you.

715
00:37:00,391 --> 00:37:02,572
If you're lying, I hope you choke on your food.

716
00:37:07,264 --> 00:37:09,520
So, should I give you CPR?

717
00:37:09,805 --> 00:37:10,992
Oh, I'm fine now.

00:37:38,664 --> 00:37:40,754
You might as well pack your clothes and move in here.

727
00:37:41,233 --> 00:37:41,856
Damn.

728
00:37:42,891 --> 00:37:44,979
His clothes are all in my closet.

729
00:37:45,514 --> 00:37:47,231
My roommate snores.

730
00:37:47,606 --> 00:37:48,670
Let me stay with you.

731
00:37:48,890 --> 00:37:51,465
Yeah, you wouldn't leave even if I tried to send you away.

732
00:37:51,570 --> 00:37:52,150
That's right.

733
00:37:53,381 --> 00:37:54,256
Let's talk about you.

734
00:37:54,890 --> 00:37:56,098
Where have you been?

735
00:37:57,935 --> 00:37:59,248
I had an errand to run.

736
00:38:00,068 --> 00:38:01,087
Mind your own business.

737
00:38:01,087 --> 00:38:02,125
Is your errand tasty?

738
00:38:04,730 --> 00:38:05,365
What?

739
00:38:06,275 --> 00:38:07,466
Here's what.

740
00:38:08,037 --> 00:38:10,109
Here it is.

741
00:38:12,370 --> 00:38:13,325
Was the food good?

742
00:38:15,394 --> 00:38:16,297
Your nose is flaring.

743
00:38:16,297 --> 00:38:17,336
Look at that face.

744
00:38:17,336 --> 00:38:17,982
You're shy.

745
00:38:17,982 --> 00:38:19,746
You're smiling.

746
00:38:19,746 --> 00:38:21,666
I'm going to take a shower.

747
00:38:22,023 --> 00:38:24,106
Hey, there's no shower on the balcony.

748
00:38:26,603 --> 00:38:28,262
I was going to watch the birds and fish.

749
00:38:28,262 --> 00:38:28,779
Damn it.

750
00:38:28,890 --> 00:38:30,070
Fish on the balcony?

751
00:38:30,070 --> 00:38:31,436
You want to watch the birds, sure.

752
00:38:31,436 --> 00:38:32,595
So was the food good?

753
00:38:33,059 --> 00:38:33,621
None of your business.

754
00:38:38,830 --> 00:38:40,220
It's okay. We have our motorbike.

755
00:38:40,220 --> 00:38:41,256
See you at uni tomorrow.

756
00:38:43,343 --> 00:38:43,921
Okay. I have to go.

757
00:38:44,313 --> 00:38:45,705
Next time you want to post my photo,

758
00:38:46,490 --> 00:38:47,863
choose a good one.

759
00:38:48,345 --> 00:38:50,081
I was chewing, Arc.

760
00:38:54,059 --> 00:38:57,840
Thank you so much for this loneliness, guys.

761
00:39:05,161 --> 00:39:07,251
Guys, if you're getting your pins,

762
00:39:07,251 --> 00:39:08,930
please gather in the auditorium.

763
00:39:08,930 --> 00:39:10,064
Don't be late.

764
00:39:10,254 --> 00:39:11,665
Got it.

765
00:39:13,225 --> 00:39:15,409
I'm too lazy to get this pin thing.

766
00:39:15,683 --> 00:39:16,535
Can we skip the ceremony?

767
00:39:18,009 --> 00:39:20,571
No, it's an official welcome for our class year.

768
00:39:20,688 --> 00:39:21,428
Hey, guys.

769
00:39:23,022 --> 00:39:24,248
I'll just leave without you as usual.

770
00:39:26,476 --> 00:39:28,310
Are you leaving without us as usual

771
00:39:29,184 --> 00:39:30,821
or is there someone picking you up as usual?

772
00:39:32,861 --> 00:39:34,370
There's really no one this time.

773
00:39:35,518 --> 00:39:36,626
I'd make you swear

774
00:39:36,626 --> 00:39:37,994
but I don't want you to die for nothing.

775
00:39:38,817 --> 00:39:39,907
I'm leaving.

776
00:39:43,061 --> 00:39:47,447
Enjoy the sacred ceremony for me.

777
00:39:52,229 --> 00:39:53,849
It'd be great if you could get me one, Po.

778
00:39:57,260 --> 00:39:57,828
Bye.

779
00:39:57,982 --> 00:39:58,515
Bye.

780
00:39:58,978 --> 00:40:00,388
Have fun leaving alone.

781
00:40:00,388 --> 00:40:00,888
Yeah.

782
00:40:01,179 --> 00:40:02,027
Just go.

783
00:40:06,878 --> 00:40:07,378
Hey.

784
00:40:08,989 --> 00:40:10,130
Where are you going, sad puppy?

785
00:40:13,747 --> 00:40:15,768
Have I ever barked at you?

786
00:40:16,419 --> 00:40:17,941
You look like a sad puppy.

787
00:40:20,135 --> 00:40:21,225
I'm going back to my room.

788
00:40:21,962 --> 00:40:22,478
I'm not going with you.

789
00:40:22,478 --> 00:40:23,366
Don't invite me. I'm going to sleep.

790
00:40:26,811 --> 00:40:28,035
It's the pin-receiving ceremony today.

791
00:40:31,052 --> 00:40:31,774
I know.

792
00:41:09,382 --> 00:41:10,187
What are you doing?

793
00:41:20,494 --> 00:41:20,994
Here you go.

794
00:41:21,542 --> 00:41:22,435

800
00:41:38,258 --> 00:41:39,413
I'll transfer it to you.

801
00:41:39,773 --> 00:41:40,646
It's just a small change.

802
00:41:41,503 --> 00:41:42,953
Right, you billionaire.

803
00:41:43,970 --> 00:41:44,792
Can I leave now?

804
00:41:45,135 --> 00:41:45,697
Not yet.

805
00:41:46,674 --> 00:41:48,198
You have to watch me play football

806
00:41:48,644 --> 00:41:49,761
in exchange for the pin.

807
00:41:50,789 --> 00:41:51,838
I can remove it.

808
00:41:51,838 --> 00:41:52,359

809
00:41:53,953 --> 00:41:54,639

Hey, dude.

817
00:42:22,984 --> 00:42:24,911
They'll start selling pins next semester.

818
00:42:25,168 --> 00:42:27,962
Anyone without one will be called out
the whole semester.

819
00:42:28,493 --> 00:42:29,965
That means Arm is going to be called out.

820
00:42:29,965 --> 00:42:31,774
Of course, he is.

821
00:42:34,534 --> 00:42:35,803
- Hi, Arc.
- Hi, Arc.

822
00:42:40,208 --> 00:42:40,976
Arm!

823
00:42:42,759 --> 00:42:44,919
Where have you been, Arm?

824
00:42:44,919 --> 00:42:45,948
I thought you were going back to the dorm.

825
00:42:46,137 --> 00:42:49,122
Oh, I had nothing to do,

826
00:42:49,122 --> 00:42:51,345
so I just went to watch Arc play football.

827
00:42:52,905 --> 00:42:53,438
Oh.

828
00:42:54,261 --> 00:42:55,300
Why do you have a pin?

829
00:42:55,300 --> 00:42:55,802
Yeah, why?

830
00:42:56,454 --> 00:42:58,085
Guys, I have to go.

831
00:42:58,393 --> 00:43:00,284
- Okay, bye.
- Bye.

832
00:43:03,712 --> 00:43:04,814
So what happened?

833
00:43:04,814 --> 00:43:05,692
How come you have a pin?

834
00:43:06,137 --> 00:43:07,276
Oh,

835
00:43:08,750 --> 00:43:09,845
I bought it.

836
00:43:10,102 --> 00:43:10,602
Just now.

837
00:43:10,734 --> 00:43:13,553
But Po told me they'd only start selling pins next semester.

838
00:43:13,553 --> 00:43:14,053
Yeah.

839
00:43:14,362 --> 00:43:14,914
Really?

840
00:43:15,891 --> 00:43:16,534
Next semester?

841
00:43:16,534 --> 00:43:17,110
Yes.

842
00:43:17,110 --> 00:43:17,700
Next semester.

843
00:43:17,854 --> 00:43:19,451
Shit, I'll be right back.

844
00:43:19,451 --> 00:43:20,008
I won't be long.

845
00:43:20,008 --> 00:43:20,508
Hey.

846
00:43:20,508 --> 00:43:21,302
Where are you going?

847
00:43:21,302 --> 00:43:21,802
Where are you going?

848
00:43:21,802 --> 00:43:22,302
Arm!

849
00:43:22,405 --> 00:43:23,051
Arm!

850
00:43:24,534 --> 00:43:25,147
Arc!

851
00:43:26,450 --> 00:43:27,034
Wait!

852
00:43:30,685 --> 00:43:31,240
Hold on.

853
00:43:33,143 --> 00:43:33,893
What's wrong?

854
00:43:35,110 --> 00:43:37,621
What's the deal about this pin?

855
00:43:37,998 --> 00:43:38,787
What do you mean?

856
00:43:39,627 --> 00:43:41,913
My friends said the pins aren't for sale yet.

857
00:43:42,804 --> 00:43:44,389
I didn't say I bought it.

858
00:43:45,692 --> 00:43:46,731
Then where did you get it?

859
00:43:48,942 --> 00:43:49,739
It's my pin.

860
00:43:52,961 --> 00:43:53,461
Huh?

861
00:44:06,147 --> 00:44:07,812
Now that you know, don't lose it.

862
00:44:16,893 --> 00:44:18,076
Why did you give it to me?

863
00:44:31,158 --> 00:44:33,374
Hey, you only got a pin.

864
00:44:35,722 --> 00:44:37,621
Why is your heart racing?

865
00:44:41,808 --> 00:44:42,929
It's not.

866
00:44:42,929 --> 00:44:44,650
You only got a pin and you're this flustered.

867
00:44:44,941 --> 00:44:48,501
If you get your gear, don't have a heart attack.

868
00:44:48,844 --> 00:44:50,040
I don't want to be a criminal.

869
00:44:51,000 --> 00:44:52,369
Your gear is meant for your partner,

870
00:44:52,935 --> 00:44:53,731
not your peer mentee's mentee.

871
00:44:54,245 --> 00:44:55,033
Do you know that?

872
00:44:55,454 --> 00:44:58,464
When did I say I'd give it to my peer mentee's mentee?

873
00:44:59,064 --> 00:45:01,033
Why do you always jump to conclusions?

874
00:45:01,924 --> 00:45:03,358
You just said it yourself

875
00:45:03,529 --> 00:45:04,720
that you'd give me your gear.

876
00:45:04,720 --> 00:45:06,025
A gear is meant for one's partner.

877
00:45:06,573 --> 00:45:07,846
I'm not your partner.

What do you mean?

882
00:45:43,914 --> 00:45:44,803
Let's not rush it.

883
00:45:45,763 --> 00:45:46,955
I'm still enjoying this.

884
00:45:49,012 --> 00:45:51,095
Let me keep flirting with you for a little longer.

I think
Arc likes you, Arm.

892
00:46:15,694 --> 00:46:16,863
That's crazy, A-ngun.

893
00:46:16,863 --> 00:46:18,210
Arc is so handsome and cool.

894
00:46:18,210 --> 00:46:19,535
He might already be dating someone.

895
00:46:19,535 --> 00:46:21,915
But when Arc found out you were badly hurt,

896
00:46:21,915 --> 00:46:23,371
he was so angry.

897
00:46:24,022 --> 00:46:25,082
Can you take me home?

898
00:46:27,447 --> 00:46:28,673
Thanks for coming to help me.

899
00:46:29,084 --> 00:46:30,626
I just don't want anything to happen to you.

900
00:46:32,803 --> 00:46:34,357
If something worse happened to you,
what would I do?

901
00:46:35,077 --> 00:46:37,696
Whether Arc likes you or not
doesn't matter now.

902
00:46:38,262 --> 00:46:40,312
How do you feel about him?
