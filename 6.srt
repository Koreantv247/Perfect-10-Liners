1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,530
Wow, Tawan.

2
00:00:00,550 --> 00:00:01,830
You really don’t care.

3
00:00:01,840 --> 00:00:03,670
Are you the newest member of Perfect 10 Liners?

4
00:00:03,700 --> 00:00:05,210
Sand, you’re getting a good one.

5
00:00:05,250 --> 00:00:07,040
What’s the ‘good one’?

6
00:00:07,070 --> 00:00:07,730
I’m hitting on you.

7
00:00:07,740 --> 00:00:08,560
Don’t you realize it at all?

8
00:00:09,330 --> 00:00:10,640
Let’s go play in the water. Come on!

9
00:00:10,670 --> 00:00:11,740
I can’t remember

10
00:00:11,770 --> 00:00:13,740
the last time I went into the sea.

11
00:00:14,250 --> 00:00:15,300
I remember.

12
00:00:15,330 --> 00:00:16,770
I broke up with my partner in the sea.

13
00:00:18,660 --> 00:00:19,890
You like him, don’t you?

14
00:00:19,920 --> 00:00:20,740
Yes.

15
00:00:20,770 --> 00:00:22,210
But it feels like he doesn’t like me.

16
00:00:22,240 --> 00:00:23,140
Listen to me, Arm.

17
00:00:23,170 --> 00:00:23,540
Right now,

18
00:00:23,560 --> 00:00:25,540
you're the only one too afraid to move on.

19
00:00:25,840 --> 00:00:27,840
Arm, do you trust me?

20
00:00:27,870 --> 00:00:29,470
I’ll lead you forward.

21
00:00:30,480 --> 00:00:31,440
What?

22
00:00:31,460 --> 00:00:32,720
Your group bracelet.

23
00:00:33,450 --> 00:00:34,630
Where did you get it?

24
00:00:34,650 --> 00:00:36,300
Don’t you want to keep it for someone you like?

25
00:00:43,210 --> 00:00:45,000
You said you won’t love anyone else again,

26
00:00:49,170 --> 00:00:50,680
but now,

27
00:00:53,120 --> 00:00:55,120
you’re not stopping anyone from loving you, right?

28
00:00:57,660 --> 00:00:59,040
I’m not sure.

29
00:01:00,740 --> 00:01:01,640
It’s okay.

30
00:01:02,280 --> 00:01:03,880
Trusting me now

31
00:01:05,110 --> 00:01:06,500
is already a big step forward.

32
00:02:00,130 --> 00:02:01,020
Hey.

33
00:02:03,440 --> 00:02:05,250
Where’s your mind going, you pervert?

34
00:02:08,840 --> 00:02:11,890
Despite how I look, I’m conservative.

35
00:02:12,810 --> 00:02:14,320
I don’t rush into things.

36
00:02:15,890 --> 00:02:16,700
Oh?

37
00:02:18,610 --> 00:02:20,380
Then why did you take off your shirt?

38
00:02:22,810 --> 00:02:23,890
It’s just hot.

39
00:02:24,670 --> 00:02:26,610
But why did you take off my shirt too?

40
00:02:29,890 --> 00:02:31,690
I thought it was hot for you too.

41
00:02:34,020 --> 00:02:35,630
Arc, you jerk!

42
00:02:35,670 --> 00:02:38,180
You’re teasing me!

43
00:02:38,200 --> 00:02:40,190
You’re teasing me!

44
00:04:39,730 --> 00:04:41,010
Why are you staring at me?

45
00:04:41,040 --> 00:04:42,370
Don’t make me poke your eyes out.

46
00:04:44,600 --> 00:04:46,290
You’re not even that cute.

47
00:04:46,650 --> 00:04:47,710
Why are you being so defensive?

48
00:04:48,950 --> 00:04:50,450
If I’m not cute, then stop looking.

49
00:04:52,740 --> 00:04:54,530
Let’s play in the water before we head back.

50
00:04:54,560 --> 00:04:55,860
I thought you said it was too hot.

51
00:04:56,160 --> 00:04:57,200
Do you want to play or not?

52
00:04:57,680 --> 00:04:58,840
I have no more clothes.

53
00:04:59,250 --> 00:05:00,690
Don’t worry.

54
00:05:00,720 --> 00:05:02,310
I have a backup plan for you.

55
00:05:30,800 --> 00:05:31,310
Arm!

56
00:05:32,010 --> 00:05:32,920
Let’s go!

57
00:05:51,400 --> 00:05:53,310
Why did you want me to play in the sea?

58
00:05:54,370 --> 00:05:55,600
It’s the beginning.

59
00:05:55,890 --> 00:05:56,440
Huh?

60
00:05:57,710 --> 00:05:59,090
The beginning of what?

61
00:06:02,680 --> 00:06:03,860
The beginning

62
00:06:06,970 --> 00:06:08,240
of leading you forward.

63
00:06:12,890 --> 00:06:15,210
You have a bad memory of the sea.

64
00:06:19,450 --> 00:06:20,770
I’m turning into a good one.

65
00:06:31,400 --> 00:06:35,470
♪ I always thought something’s missing in my life ♪

66
00:06:35,510 --> 00:06:39,890
♪ Living through each day, feeling empty inside ♪

67

♪ There’s only loneliness till we met that day ♪

68
00:06:48,460 --> 00:06:49,570
The past

69
00:06:51,180 --> 00:06:52,760
doesn’t matter.

70
00:06:55,580 --> 00:06:58,700
From now on,

71
00:07:00,910 --> 00:07:02,390
I’m going to make things better.

72
00:07:03,150 --> 00:07:07,360

81
00:07:52,900 --> 00:07:55,880
This is your backup plan?

82
00:07:57,530 --> 00:07:58,430
Why?

83
00:07:59,480 --> 00:08:00,620
Do you prefer not wearing it?

84
00:08:00,640 --> 00:08:01,030
Take it off then.

85
00:08:01,050 --> 00:08:01,250
Hey!

86
00:08:03,680 --> 00:08:05,840
Are you sure security won’t think we stole them?

87
00:08:06,560 --> 00:08:07,890
I bought them.

88
00:08:08,770 --> 00:08:10,580
Of course, you used money to solve the problem.

89
00:08:10,610 --> 00:08:11,490
I have money.

90
00:08:12,160 --> 00:08:13,780
Yes, you’re rich.

91
00:08:31,700 --> 00:08:32,120
Wait.

92
00:08:37,550 --> 00:08:38,710
About this morning,

93
00:08:39,500 --> 00:08:40,850
don’t get me wrong.

94
00:08:41,320 --> 00:08:42,500
I wasn’t messing with you.

95
00:08:43,000 --> 00:08:44,210
Whoa.

96
00:08:45,200 --> 00:08:47,860
If that wasn’t messing with me, then what was it?

97
00:08:48,340 --> 00:08:49,210
Respecting you.

98
00:08:50,120 --> 00:08:50,730
Huh?

99
00:08:51,700 --> 00:08:53,620
Well, you’ve never told me

100
00:08:53,650 --> 00:08:55,200
whether you like me or not.

101
00:08:55,220 --> 00:08:56,900
If we’d gone any further,

102
00:08:56,930 --> 00:08:58,690
you wouldn’t be able to go back and fix it.

103
00:09:00,860 --> 00:09:04,370
Not just with me, but with anyone.

104
00:09:06,500 --> 00:09:07,880
What are you talking about?

105
00:09:08,540 --> 00:09:11,040
Don’t be so easy.

106
00:09:11,500 --> 00:09:12,950
Excuse me?

107
00:09:12,980 --> 00:09:14,410
Who are you calling easy?

108
00:09:14,830 --> 00:09:16,260
I’m not.

109
00:09:17,460 --> 00:09:19,280
I want there to be

110
00:09:19,300 --> 00:09:20,610
only good things between us.

111
00:09:21,060 --> 00:09:22,280
I don’t want you to be dumb

112
00:09:22,310 --> 00:09:24,040
and get the wrong idea that I’m messing with you.

113
00:09:32,530 --> 00:09:33,640
It’s Pun.

114
00:09:36,180 --> 00:09:37,410
Hi, Pun.

115
00:09:37,600 --> 00:09:39,320
Are you back in Bangkok yet?

116
00:09:39,670 --> 00:09:41,320
How’s the bracelet thing?

117
00:09:42,130 --> 00:09:43,750
Oh,

118
00:09:47,170 --> 00:09:48,260
I got mine.

119
00:09:48,290 --> 00:09:48,980
Oh?

120
00:09:49,330 --> 00:09:51,000
Why did Tawan tell me

121
00:09:51,020 --> 00:09:52,690
you’d make plans to go back another time?

122
00:09:52,980 --> 00:09:54,000
What’s going on?

123
00:09:54,030 --> 00:09:55,790
Oh…

124
00:09:56,780 --> 00:09:58,080
Um…

125
00:09:58,110 --> 00:09:59,540
Ooh!

126
00:09:59,570 --> 00:10:00,740
Don’t tell me…

127
00:10:00,770 --> 00:10:01,440
The puppy was sad,

128
00:10:01,480 --> 00:10:02,560
so I gave him one of my bracelets.

129
00:10:02,590 --> 00:10:04,170
Oh, you guys are so annoying.

130
00:10:04,210 --> 00:10:06,510
I don’t want to take any more of your sweet time.

131
00:10:06,530 --> 00:10:07,490
Bye.

132
00:10:08,010 --> 00:10:09,150
Wait, Pun.

133
00:10:09,650 --> 00:10:12,750
Please don’t tell anyone about the bracelets.

134
00:10:12,780 --> 00:10:14,080
Sharing your sweet story

135
00:10:14,110 --> 00:10:15,920
would do a lot of good, you know?

136
00:10:16,880 --> 00:10:18,260
No, thank you.

137
00:10:18,280 --> 00:10:19,850
I’d rather sin.

138
00:10:19,900 --> 00:10:20,850
I’m just kidding.

139
00:10:20,890 --> 00:10:21,650
I won’t take up any more of your time.

140
00:10:21,670 --> 00:10:23,490
Go spend it with the two of you.

141
00:10:24,290 --> 00:10:25,080
Bye.

142
00:10:30,900 --> 00:10:31,890
I’m going now.

143
00:10:37,890 --> 00:10:39,140
By the way, Arc.

144
00:10:41,440 --> 00:10:42,820
If you find someone

145
00:10:43,980 --> 00:10:46,560
you rather give this bracelet to than me,

146
00:10:47,250 --> 00:10:48,640
you can take it back.

147
00:10:49,350 --> 00:10:50,560
Don’t worry about making me feel bad.

148
00:10:51,010 --> 00:10:53,010
I already gave it to you. I won’t take it back.

149
00:10:53,370 --> 00:10:55,680
But if one day you don’t want to wear it,

150
00:10:55,710 --> 00:10:57,280
you can take it off and give it back to me.

151
00:10:57,300 --> 00:10:58,460
I won’t mind.

152
00:11:03,090 --> 00:11:03,860
Bye then.

153
00:11:05,410 --> 00:11:06,500
One more thing.

154
00:11:07,940 --> 00:11:08,960
What is it?

155
00:11:09,380 --> 00:11:10,370
You’ve never told me

156
00:11:10,390 --> 00:11:12,080
whether you like me or not.

157
00:11:12,680 --> 00:11:13,600
Oh,

158
00:11:14,350 --> 00:11:16,350
I don’t have an answer for you right now.

159
00:11:16,800 --> 00:11:18,270
I’m not expecting an answer.

160
00:11:18,290 --> 00:11:19,680
Oh? Then what?

161
00:11:20,610 --> 00:11:21,920
I just wanted to tell you

162
00:11:23,110 --> 00:11:24,110
I like you.

163
00:11:24,880 --> 00:11:25,670

173
00:11:52,490 --> 00:11:53,700
I’m not giving it back.

174
00:11:53,720 --> 00:11:55,120
Don’t even ask for it back.

175
00:11:58,240 --> 00:12:00,590
If you ever give the bracelet back to me,

176
00:12:00,630 --> 00:12:01,860
I’ll cry like crazy.

177
00:12:02,800 --> 00:12:04,040
Don’t do it, Arm.

178
00:12:04,440 --> 00:12:06,510
♪ If you’ve got feelings, say it straight ♪

179
00:12:06,540 --> 00:12:08,510
♪ I’m tired of guessing, can no longer wait ♪

180
00:12:08,540 --> 00:12:11,360
♪ If I fall head over heels for you ♪

181
00:12:11,380 --> 00:12:13,850
♪ Then I can point the finger at who? ♪

182
00:12:15,850 --> 00:12:17,120
Hey, guys.

183
00:12:17,160 --> 00:12:18,630
Hey, Arm.

184
00:12:19,100 --> 00:12:20,480
You’re back.

185
00:12:20,930 --> 00:12:21,880
What are you wearing?

186
00:12:23,880 --> 00:12:25,070
It’s a long story.

187
00:12:28,320 --> 00:12:30,030
My grandma made us mixed vegetable stew.

188
00:12:30,050 --> 00:12:31,030
It’s in the fridge.

189
00:12:31,050 --> 00:12:31,950
It’s nice and mushy.

190
00:12:31,970 --> 00:12:32,770
Okay.

191
00:12:33,490 --> 00:12:35,490
Damn it!

192
00:12:37,130 --> 00:12:40,190
It can’t be more mushy than my feelings.

193
00:12:42,810 --> 00:12:43,600
What’s wrong?

194
00:12:43,640 --> 00:12:45,400
Did the seawater burn you?

195
00:12:45,420 --> 00:12:46,510
Are you okay, Arm?

196
00:12:47,010 --> 00:12:48,510
Who hurt you? Arc?

197
00:12:52,100 --> 00:12:54,850
From now on, I’m going to make things better.

198
00:13:06,180 --> 00:13:08,330
Oh, damn it!

199
00:13:09,640 --> 00:13:10,390
Po.

200
00:13:10,820 --> 00:13:11,860
Sand.

201
00:13:13,890 --> 00:13:14,800
I think

202
00:13:17,330 --> 00:13:18,740
Arc likes me.

203
00:13:18,780 --> 00:13:19,590
What?

204
00:13:19,610 --> 00:13:20,560
What?

205
00:13:20,580 --> 00:13:23,960
Did my friend sleep with him?

206
00:13:24,130 --> 00:13:25,760
This can’t be true.

207
00:13:25,790 --> 00:13:27,120
I didn’t sleep with him.

208
00:13:27,150 --> 00:13:28,630
We just kissed.

209
00:13:29,180 --> 00:13:31,900
Oh, you just kissed.

210
00:13:32,530 --> 00:13:32,980
What?

211
00:13:33,000 --> 00:13:34,020
Hey!

212
00:13:35,500 --> 00:13:37,040
Yes, we just kissed.

213
00:13:39,640 --> 00:13:42,370
Did Arc bite your lips?

214
00:13:43,170 --> 00:13:44,190
No, he didn’t.

215
00:13:44,630 --> 00:13:47,780
Were his lips soft?

216
00:13:48,070 --> 00:13:48,930
Hey!

217
00:13:49,590 --> 00:13:51,030
Why does it matter if his lips were soft?

218
00:13:51,060 --> 00:13:52,000
They weren’t!

219
00:13:52,590 --> 00:13:54,860
You guys kissed.

220
00:13:55,360 --> 00:13:56,760
What’s your status?

221
00:13:56,790 --> 00:13:57,860
What is it now?

222
00:13:58,700 --> 00:13:59,650
Nothing.

223
00:14:01,680 --> 00:14:04,690
What we know for sure is

224
00:14:04,720 --> 00:14:05,560
our friend has fallen for him.

225
00:14:05,590 --> 00:14:07,120
That’s a sure thing.

226
00:14:10,530 --> 00:14:12,010
Oh!

227
00:14:13,230 --> 00:14:14,620
Stop it, guys.

228
00:14:14,650 --> 00:14:16,160
Damn it!

229
00:14:21,440 --> 00:14:22,370
Hey, Arc.

230
00:14:22,390 --> 00:14:23,260
Hmm?

231
00:14:23,280 --> 00:14:24,830
How was your sweet little beach trip?

232
00:14:33,110 --> 00:14:35,320
I can’t believe a grumpy guy like you is wearing this.

233
00:14:36,160 --> 00:14:37,810
How did Arm do it?

234
00:14:37,840 --> 00:14:38,780
Right?

235
00:14:38,800 --> 00:14:39,950
It’s unbelievable.

236
00:14:40,320 --> 00:14:42,400
Love really changes people.

237
00:14:42,860 --> 00:14:44,220
It’s amazing.

238
00:14:44,250 --> 00:14:45,860
So what happened?

239
00:14:46,130 --> 00:14:47,050
Yeah, what happened?

240
00:14:47,070 --> 00:14:48,020
Are you together now?

241
00:14:54,020 --> 00:14:55,050
No, not yet.

242
00:14:55,060 --> 00:14:56,480
Come on!

243
00:14:56,900 --> 00:14:58,440
We were rooting for you.

244
00:14:58,460 --> 00:14:59,620
What’s the rush, guys?

245
00:15:00,050 --> 00:15:02,180
We want to take it slow and get to know each other.

246
00:15:02,210 --> 00:15:03,170
Right.

247
00:15:03,200 --> 00:15:04,610
Arc is serious about him.

248
00:15:05,030 --> 00:15:07,380
Yes, he doesn’t date casually like you do, Warm.

249
00:15:07,400 --> 00:15:08,000
Hey.

250
00:15:08,380 --> 00:15:10,380
I just haven’t found someone I click with.

251
00:15:10,980 --> 00:15:12,580
I’m glad our friend has.

252
00:15:16,490 --> 00:15:18,570
Hey, guys.

253
00:15:18,610 --> 00:15:20,060
Why are there so many cars today?

254
00:15:20,080 --> 00:15:22,260
They’re here for the Engineers Unite.

255
00:15:22,290 --> 00:15:23,330
Oh, already?

256
00:15:23,350 --> 00:15:24,380
Yes.

257
00:15:24,400 --> 00:15:27,180
Have you guys found out who your buddies are?

258
00:15:27,650 --> 00:15:28,780
Pond told me he knows my buddy.

259
00:15:28,800 --> 00:15:30,230
I’ll meet them this evening.

260
00:15:31,160 --> 00:15:32,280
And you, Arm?

261
00:15:32,700 --> 00:15:35,140
Not yet. I didn’t have time to figure it out.

262
00:15:35,170 --> 00:15:36,510
Of course.

263
00:15:36,530 --> 00:15:38,680
While others were decoding the hints,

264
00:15:38,700 --> 00:15:41,240
you were busy counting sheep with Arc.

265
00:15:41,280 --> 00:15:42,820
Counting sheep, my ass.

266
00:15:42,840 --> 00:15:43,900
We didn’t do that.

267
00:15:43,930 --> 00:15:44,770
Arm.

268
00:15:47,760 --> 00:15:49,220
Why are you here?

269
00:15:49,860 --> 00:15:51,280
You have class at 10:30 right?

270
00:15:51,780 --> 00:15:52,440
Get in the car.

271
00:15:52,470 --> 00:15:53,700
Come have breakfast with me.

272
00:15:56,820 --> 00:15:58,820
Have fun counting sheep.

273
00:15:58,850 --> 00:16:00,180
Po and I won’t bother you anymore.

274
00:16:00,210 --> 00:16:02,180
Enjoy your “counting sheep” meal.

275
00:16:02,420 --> 00:16:03,290
See you.

276
00:16:04,370 --> 00:16:05,980
One, two.

277
00:16:06,710 --> 00:16:08,710
Five, six, seven, eight.

278
00:16:11,340 --> 00:16:12,510
What’s wrong with you?

279
00:16:12,530 --> 00:16:13,510
Why did you have to sound so harsh

280
00:16:13,540 --> 00:16:14,950
inviting me to breakfast?

281
00:16:15,820 --> 00:16:16,950
It’s my normal voice.

282
00:16:16,970 --> 00:16:18,900
Normal, my ass.

283
00:16:19,360 --> 00:16:20,770
What did your mom feed you

284
00:16:20,800 --> 00:16:22,770
when you were a baby?

285
00:16:23,150 --> 00:16:25,250
Why? Do I have to say sweet things

286
00:16:25,280 --> 00:16:26,620
when asking you out on a meal?

287
00:16:28,240 --> 00:16:29,680
Do whatever you want.

288
00:16:29,710 --> 00:16:31,500
Just don’t punch my face.

289
00:16:32,620 --> 00:16:34,070
I won’t punch your face.

290
00:16:39,700 --> 00:16:41,200
I don’t want to bruise your cheeks.

291
00:16:42,770 --> 00:16:43,380
What?

292
00:16:44,160 --> 00:16:45,180
Did you think I was going to

293
00:16:45,200 --> 00:16:46,730
kiss you on the cheek here?

294
00:16:46,770 --> 00:16:47,520
Huh?

295
00:16:49,630 --> 00:16:50,740
Who knows?

296
00:16:50,770 --> 00:16:52,740
With you, anything can happen.

297
00:16:55,890 --> 00:16:56,960
Hey!

298
00:16:56,990 --> 00:16:58,130
Arc!

299
00:16:58,780 --> 00:16:59,920
You were right to think that.

300
00:16:59,940 --> 00:17:00,820
Get in the car.

301
00:17:00,850 --> 00:17:02,100
What did you do?

302
00:17:04,430 --> 00:17:05,480
I kissed a puppy.

303
00:17:16,990 --> 00:17:18,020
Hey, Arc.

304
00:17:19,080 --> 00:17:20,690
This evening is the warm-up match, right?

305
00:17:20,710 --> 00:17:22,120
For the Engineers Unite.

306
00:17:22,530 --> 00:17:23,490
I guess.

307
00:17:23,520 --> 00:17:25,600
Have you drawn your secret buddy?

308
00:17:25,630 --> 00:17:27,020
Is your buddy a girl or a boy?

309
00:17:27,040 --> 00:17:27,900
I don’t know.

310
00:17:28,260 --> 00:17:30,340
What do you think I should get for my buddy?

311
00:17:30,360 --> 00:17:32,340
Something impressive

312
00:17:32,370 --> 00:17:33,890
that they can keep as a memory.

313
00:17:33,910 --> 00:17:34,640
Snacks.

314
00:17:34,990 --> 00:17:36,990
How can snacks be a memory?

315
00:17:37,010 --> 00:17:38,280
Once eaten, they’re gone.

316
00:17:38,310 --> 00:17:38,990
You’re right.

317
00:17:40,040 --> 00:17:42,800
What are you going to get for your buddy?

318
00:17:43,420 --> 00:17:44,440
Do I have to?

319
00:17:44,820 --> 00:17:45,660
Come on.

320
00:17:46,090 --> 00:17:47,280
Yes, you do.

321
00:17:48,770 --> 00:17:50,640
Have you ever cared about anything in your life?

322
00:17:50,660 --> 00:17:52,100
Only what I want to care about.

323
00:17:52,930 --> 00:17:53,680
Like what?

324
00:17:54,210 --> 00:17:55,040
You.

325
00:18:11,220 --> 00:18:12,500
Why are you looking at me?

326
00:18:12,530 --> 00:18:13,590
Just eat.

327
00:18:22,450 --> 00:18:24,480
Ugh, what should we do with him?

328
00:18:24,510 --> 00:18:26,670
Yeah, what should we do with him?

329
00:18:26,700 --> 00:18:27,400
Hey, A-ngun.

330
00:18:29,000 --> 00:18:30,310
Is the teacher not here yet?

331
00:18:30,790 --> 00:18:32,500
If they were, you’d already see them.

332
00:18:34,570 --> 00:18:35,520
Where did you go?

333
00:18:35,550 --> 00:18:37,010
Did you enjoy counting sheep?

334
00:18:37,030 --> 00:18:38,300
How many did you count?

335
00:18:39,000 --> 00:18:39,900
Shut up!

336
00:18:41,510 --> 00:18:42,800
Watch your spit!

337
00:18:43,780 --> 00:18:44,810
Did you bring our assignment?

338
00:18:44,830 --> 00:18:46,130
We need to submit it in front of the class.

339
00:18:46,150 --> 00:18:46,740
Really?

340
00:18:46,760 --> 00:18:47,460
Yeah.

341
00:18:49,330 --> 00:18:50,020
I’m so tired.

342
00:18:50,050 --> 00:18:51,640
I feel like I’m raising a child.

343
00:18:55,640 --> 00:18:56,380
What?

344
00:18:57,060 --> 00:18:58,340
Shit!

345
00:18:58,360 --> 00:18:59,650
Don’t tell me…

346
00:19:00,180 --> 00:19:01,720
I must have forgotten it in Arc’s car.

347
00:19:01,760 --> 00:19:03,410
Seriously?

348
00:19:04,320 --> 00:19:05,590
What should we do?

349
00:19:05,620 --> 00:19:06,560
When’s the deadline?

350
00:19:06,590 --> 00:19:07,230
Today!

351
00:19:07,260 --> 00:19:08,360
It’s due today.

352
00:19:09,400 --> 00:19:10,000
Damn it!

353
00:19:10,020 --> 00:19:11,460
What were you thinking?

354
00:19:11,540 --> 00:19:12,580
I can’t believe it.

355
00:19:12,610 --> 00:19:14,980
Why did you take it out while in his car?

356
00:19:16,370 --> 00:19:17,120
A-ngun.

357
00:19:17,140 --> 00:19:17,860
Hmm?

358
00:19:26,280 --> 00:19:27,130
Hey, Arc!

359
00:19:27,150 --> 00:19:28,080
I’m here.

360
00:19:29,250 --> 00:19:30,360
Come down.

361
00:19:30,390 --> 00:19:32,080
You left your assignment in my car.

362
00:19:38,020 --> 00:19:39,650
You went through the trouble of

363
00:19:39,680 --> 00:19:41,410
giving me a ride and coming up here.

364
00:19:41,470 --> 00:19:42,540
I’m sorry.

365
00:19:42,560 --> 00:19:43,220
Yeah.

366
00:19:43,780 --> 00:19:46,400
How did you know my class was here?

367
00:19:46,950 --> 00:19:48,170
I pay attention.

368
00:19:49,760 --> 00:19:50,820
Isn’t that too much?

369
00:19:50,850 --> 00:19:51,810
It is too much.

370
00:19:51,830 --> 00:19:52,570
Right?

371
00:19:52,980 --> 00:19:54,400
Keep it down, Arc!

372
00:19:54,430 --> 00:19:55,110
Why?

373
00:19:56,090 --> 00:19:57,290
Give that to me

374
00:19:57,860 --> 00:19:58,490
Here you go.

375
00:19:59,810 --> 00:20:00,750
Thank you.

376
00:20:01,970 --> 00:20:03,060
Pay attention in class.

377
00:20:16,640 --> 00:20:18,260
I don’t get it at all.

378
00:20:18,300 --> 00:20:19,620
I always get the lessons.

379
00:20:19,650 --> 00:20:20,160
I’m so bored.

380
00:20:20,190 --> 00:20:21,270
It all got into my brain.

381
00:20:21,300 --> 00:20:23,570
Oh, you guys are so smart.

382
00:20:23,600 --> 00:20:24,900
We’re just good at everything.

383
00:20:24,920 --> 00:20:26,900
You finally got your matching bracelet.

384
00:20:30,640 --> 00:20:31,850
What?

385
00:20:32,180 --> 00:20:34,180
This one is mine, A-ngun.

386
00:20:34,420 --> 00:20:36,070
Every member of Perfect 10 Liners

387
00:20:36,100 --> 00:20:37,630
has their own pair of bracelets.

388
00:20:37,680 --> 00:20:38,930
You got it wrong.

389
00:20:39,600 --> 00:20:41,120
Where’s the other one then?

390
00:20:41,520 --> 00:20:43,120
Can I see it?

391
00:20:46,180 --> 00:20:49,410
Oh, it’s at home.

392
00:20:49,770 --> 00:20:50,660
Arm,

393
00:20:50,690 --> 00:20:52,190
you don’t need to hide it from me.

394
00:20:53,380 --> 00:20:55,000
About my crush on Arc,

395
00:20:56,280 --> 00:20:58,280
don’t worry.

396
00:20:58,310 --> 00:21:00,280
I was just a fan of his.

397
00:21:00,400 --> 00:21:03,020
But now, I’m a fan of your couple.

398
00:21:05,380 --> 00:21:06,460
My couple?

399
00:21:07,320 --> 00:21:09,340
You and Arc, of course.

400
00:21:09,360 --> 00:21:10,740
You guys are cute.

401
00:21:11,630 --> 00:21:13,960
How cute.

402
00:21:14,890 --> 00:21:15,950
Shut up, guys.

403
00:21:17,220 --> 00:21:18,000
By the way,

404
00:21:18,440 --> 00:21:20,720
are you going to watch the warm-up match?

405
00:21:20,740 --> 00:21:22,340
Of course.

406
00:21:22,360 --> 00:21:23,470
How could we miss it?

407
00:21:23,490 --> 00:21:24,830
Then let’s go.

408
00:21:24,860 --> 00:21:25,440
Get up.

409
00:21:25,470 --> 00:21:26,330
Hey.

410
00:21:26,370 --> 00:21:27,890
What’s the hurry?

411
00:21:28,400 --> 00:21:29,510
Are you going to watch the game

412
00:21:29,530 --> 00:21:31,030
or a certain player?

413
00:21:34,590 --> 00:21:35,070
Sorry.

414
00:21:37,110 --> 00:21:39,250
That applies to all of you.

415
00:21:39,280 --> 00:21:40,580
I won’t tease you next time.

416
00:21:43,480 --> 00:21:44,460
It’s so sunny.

417
00:21:44,820 --> 00:21:46,040
Damn it.

418
00:21:46,820 --> 00:21:47,500
Can we turn the sun off?

419
00:21:47,540 --> 00:21:49,380
Where’s A-ngun?

420
00:21:50,410 --> 00:21:50,970
I think she found her buddy

421
00:21:50,990 --> 00:21:52,080
and is with them.

422
00:21:58,880 --> 00:22:00,720
Go, Pond!

423
00:22:01,250 --> 00:22:02,820
Go, Sand!

424
00:22:02,840 --> 00:22:04,210
Rooting for you!

425
00:22:04,230 --> 00:22:05,780
Why did he say it back?

426
00:22:05,810 --> 00:22:06,450
What are you doing?

427
00:22:06,470 --> 00:22:07,860
You’re just standing next to me.

428
00:22:08,490 --> 00:22:09,860
You’re so crazy.

429
00:22:09,880 --> 00:22:11,440
Arm, look at your friend.

430
00:22:14,930 --> 00:22:15,910
Sand,

431
00:22:15,930 --> 00:22:16,530
look at him.

432
00:22:17,320 --> 00:22:18,370
How are you?

433
00:22:19,190 --> 00:22:20,090
Are you tired?

434
00:22:21,280 --> 00:22:22,090
You must be.

435
00:22:27,810 --> 00:22:28,490
Hi, Mom.

436
00:22:28,510 --> 00:22:29,770
I’m happy here.

437
00:22:29,800 --> 00:22:32,050
My friends love me so much.

438
00:22:32,070 --> 00:22:33,090
I really love it here.

439
00:22:33,120 --> 00:22:34,630
My friends are so nice.

440
00:22:36,650 --> 00:22:38,100
Why do I have to go through this?

441
00:22:38,130 --> 00:22:39,360
What do they think of me?

442
00:22:39,400 --> 00:22:40,640
I’m not a clown.

443
00:22:40,670 --> 00:22:41,440
I’m handsome.

444
00:22:41,470 --> 00:22:43,810
Sand, wait for me!

445
00:22:44,450 --> 00:22:45,820
Why aren’t you on the field?

446
00:22:47,210 --> 00:22:48,500
I’ve been waiting for you.

447
00:22:49,620 --> 00:22:50,730
Waiting for me?

448
00:22:51,470 --> 00:22:52,380
Yeah.

449
00:22:52,400 --> 00:22:53,420
Why?

450
00:22:54,270 --> 00:22:55,790
I want you to watch me play.

451
00:22:56,320 --> 00:22:57,360
Are you serious?

452
00:22:57,390 --> 00:22:58,230
Yes.

453
00:22:58,890 --> 00:23:00,480
How’s the score?

454
00:23:02,450 --> 00:23:03,620
We’re behind.

455
00:23:05,330 --> 00:23:06,420
Then go.

456
00:23:06,450 --> 00:23:07,820
Go help your friends already.

457
00:23:09,470 --> 00:23:10,190
Krub.

458
00:23:15,960 --> 00:23:16,580
Krub.

459
00:23:18,510 --> 00:23:19,370
Krub.

460
00:23:19,690 --> 00:23:20,310
Krub.

461
00:23:20,650 --> 00:23:22,150
Did he just say "Okay" so nicely?

462
00:23:25,360 --> 00:23:26,140
Krub.

463
00:23:48,140 --> 00:23:48,770
Po.

464
00:24:02,430 --> 00:24:03,450
We won.

465
00:24:03,470 --> 00:24:05,090
Let’s celebrate tonight.

466
00:24:05,120 --> 00:24:06,050
Yes.

467
00:24:06,800 --> 00:24:07,910
Where are you guys going?

468
00:24:09,570 --> 00:24:11,020
So when you were with Arc,

469
00:24:11,050 --> 00:24:12,710
you didn’t read the group chat at all?

470
00:24:12,740 --> 00:24:13,490
Seriously.

471
00:24:13,820 --> 00:24:14,820
We’re going out for drinks tonight.

472
00:24:14,850 --> 00:24:15,380
Yeah.

473
00:24:15,400 --> 00:24:16,820
The whole male dorm is going.

474
00:24:16,850 --> 00:24:17,760
Really?

475
00:24:18,100 --> 00:24:18,690
Yes.

476
00:24:19,300 --> 00:24:20,320
Damn,

477
00:24:20,830 --> 00:24:21,810
I don’t think I can go.

478
00:24:21,840 --> 00:24:23,420
Come on.

479
00:24:23,440 --> 00:24:25,630
Arc warned me last time.

480
00:24:25,670 --> 00:24:26,920
Come on, Arm.

481
00:24:26,950 --> 00:24:28,520
We need you.

482
00:24:28,550 --> 00:24:29,890
We can’t live without you.

483
00:24:29,920 --> 00:24:30,900
Don’t say that.

484
00:24:30,930 --> 00:24:32,250
I want to go,

485
00:24:32,720 --> 00:24:35,050
but I still have the scar from the wound on my head.

486
00:24:35,070 --> 00:24:36,180
I can’t believe Arc.

487
00:24:36,210 --> 00:24:37,880
Yeah, what’s wrong with him?

488
00:24:37,910 --> 00:24:38,710
-What do you do?
-	Damn.

489
00:24:38,900 --> 00:24:40,320
Are you talking about me?

490
00:24:42,850 --> 00:24:43,850
No.

491
00:24:51,330 --> 00:24:52,610
Why did you take off your shirt?

492
00:24:53,410 --> 00:24:54,500
It’s hot.

493
00:24:54,520 --> 00:24:55,860
I’m sweating all over.

494
00:24:56,550 --> 00:24:58,680
Your body doesn’t even look that good.

495
00:24:59,130 --> 00:25:00,690
Stop showing off.

496
00:25:00,720 --> 00:25:03,240
Hey, that body you're talking about

497
00:25:03,260 --> 00:25:04,580
has six-packs that line up

498
00:25:04,610 --> 00:25:05,660
more beautifully than the walls at my house.

499
00:25:05,680 --> 00:25:06,680
His walls are beautiful.

500
00:25:06,700 --> 00:25:07,060
I’ve seen them.

501
00:25:07,080 --> 00:25:07,700
Yeah.

502
00:25:09,160 --> 00:25:10,000
Stop exaggerating.

503
00:25:10,520 --> 00:25:11,570
I won, Sand.

504
00:25:11,600 --> 00:25:12,320
Am I amazing?

505
00:25:12,340 --> 00:25:13,510
Yes, you are.

506
00:25:15,540 --> 00:25:16,670
Will I get a reward?

507
00:25:16,700 --> 00:25:17,370
No.

508
00:25:17,400 --> 00:25:18,200
Really?

509
00:25:19,700 --> 00:25:21,040
Don’t celebrate just yet.

510
00:25:21,070 --> 00:25:21,880
Whose voice is that?

511
00:25:21,910 --> 00:25:24,390
I heard the other team has a secret weapon.

512
00:25:25,840 --> 00:25:27,300
A secret weapon?

513
00:25:27,330 --> 00:25:29,040
A mysterious player

514
00:25:29,080 --> 00:25:30,410
who rarely shows up to practice.

515
00:25:30,450 --> 00:25:32,240
But when we see them on the field,

516
00:25:33,140 --> 00:25:34,750
they’re insanely good.

517
00:25:35,470 --> 00:25:37,010
Damn.

518
00:25:38,550 --> 00:25:39,310
Hey.

519
00:25:39,560 --> 00:25:40,580
You guys have me.

520
00:25:40,600 --> 00:25:41,860
What are you afraid of?

521
00:25:43,810 --> 00:25:46,580
Don’t get too sure of yourself, Arc.

522
00:25:46,620 --> 00:25:48,210
If you lose,

523
00:25:48,240 --> 00:25:51,140
I can’t save your face.

524
00:25:53,440 --> 00:25:55,890
Shall we give him an incentive prize?

525
00:25:56,730 --> 00:25:58,180
What do you mean?

526
00:25:58,440 --> 00:26:01,720
Let’s say if our university wins,

527
00:26:01,740 --> 00:26:03,650
Arm must kiss Arc on the cheek

528
00:26:03,680 --> 00:26:04,800
in the middle of the field.

529
00:26:08,310 --> 00:26:09,300
Yes!

530
00:26:09,320 --> 00:26:10,050
Isn’t that a good idea?

531
00:26:10,080 --> 00:26:10,740
Yes.

532
00:26:10,760 --> 00:26:12,180
But I have a better one.

533
00:26:12,200 --> 00:26:13,600
How about this?

534
00:26:13,650 --> 00:26:15,700
If Arc scores 3 points,

535
00:26:16,240 --> 00:26:18,690
Arm must agree to be his boyfriend.

536
00:26:19,710 --> 00:26:20,900
I like it.

537
00:26:22,410 --> 00:26:22,930
Well…

538
00:26:25,400 --> 00:26:26,080
Hey,

539
00:26:26,660 --> 00:26:28,660
where are you guys going after this?

540
00:26:31,290 --> 00:26:32,720
Nowhere.

541
00:26:35,130 --> 00:26:36,180
We’re heading back to our dorm.

542
00:26:40,180 --> 00:26:41,260
Cheers!

543
00:26:53,290 --> 00:26:55,590
I’m going! I’m going!

544
00:26:55,620 --> 00:26:57,110
I’m going!

545
00:26:59,860 --> 00:27:01,490
I’m going!

546
00:27:01,520 --> 00:27:02,220
To the moon!

547
00:27:02,240 --> 00:27:03,910
Oh, shit!

548
00:27:03,940 --> 00:27:05,230
Arm!

549
00:27:05,270 --> 00:27:05,910
Arm!

550
00:27:05,930 --> 00:27:06,480
What?

551
00:27:06,520 --> 00:27:07,170
Arm!

552
00:27:07,180 --> 00:27:08,500
Who’s fighting now?

553
00:27:08,530 --> 00:27:09,140
Arm!

554
00:27:09,170 --> 00:27:10,300
What’s wrong, Po?

555
00:27:10,320 --> 00:27:11,440
What?

556
00:27:12,460 --> 00:27:13,570
What is it?

557
00:27:13,610 --> 00:27:14,970
Shit!

558
00:27:15,010 --> 00:27:15,990
Po!

559
00:27:16,010 --> 00:27:16,660
What should I do?

560
00:27:16,680 --> 00:27:17,300
What should I do?

561
00:27:17,320 --> 00:27:17,990
What should I do?

562
00:27:18,030 --> 00:27:18,550
Help me!

563
00:27:18,570 --> 00:27:19,190
Sand!

564
00:27:19,220 --> 00:27:20,660
What’s wrong with you?

565
00:27:20,690 --> 00:27:21,670
ARC

566
00:27:22,600 --> 00:27:23,920
Let’s go home.

567
00:27:23,960 --> 00:27:25,510
Let’s go home.

568
00:27:26,460 --> 00:27:27,330
Help me!

569
00:27:27,520 --> 00:27:28,830
Help me, Sand!

570
00:27:28,860 --> 00:27:29,380
What should I do?

571
00:27:29,400 --> 00:27:29,960
What should I do?

572
00:27:29,990 --> 00:27:31,310
I don’t know what to do.

573
00:27:31,340 --> 00:27:31,750
I don’t know.

574
00:27:31,770 --> 00:27:32,530
Stop!

575
00:27:35,460 --> 00:27:36,530
I have a plan.

576
00:27:37,140 --> 00:27:38,890
Can I borrow this?

577
00:27:41,470 --> 00:27:42,570
We’ll be fine.

578
00:27:45,310 --> 00:27:46,000
Calm down!

579
00:27:46,030 --> 00:27:46,890
Calm down!

580
00:27:46,930 --> 00:27:48,270
Calm down!

581
00:27:49,280 --> 00:27:50,370
Calm down!

582
00:27:54,420 --> 00:27:55,490
What do we do?

583
00:27:55,520 --> 00:27:56,570
Hurry!

584
00:27:57,920 --> 00:27:59,900
You need to make it believable.

585
00:27:59,940 --> 00:28:01,000
Take off your shirt.

586
00:28:01,020 --> 00:28:02,550
Take it off.

587
00:28:04,410 --> 00:28:05,120
Help me!

588
00:28:06,820 --> 00:28:07,930
Blanket on.

589
00:28:07,950 --> 00:28:10,510
After you pick up the call, try to sound sleepy.

590
00:28:10,550 --> 00:28:11,900
Sound sleepy.

591
00:28:14,850 --> 00:28:15,760
Let’s go, Po!

592
00:28:15,790 --> 00:28:16,610
Stay with me!

593
00:28:16,620 --> 00:28:17,410
Stay with me!

594
00:28:17,440 --> 00:28:18,680
No!

595
00:28:18,720 --> 00:28:20,700
I’m out!

596
00:28:21,770 --> 00:28:22,640
I’ll answer it now.

597
00:28:25,730 --> 00:28:26,590
Hello.

598
00:28:26,610 --> 00:28:27,450
Are you sleeping?

599
00:28:27,480 --> 00:28:29,490
Mm.

600
00:28:29,510 --> 00:28:30,970
You’re sleeping shirtless.

601
00:28:31,500 --> 00:28:34,101
The AC is warm.

602
00:28:34,138 --> 00:28:36,116
Then why did you put on a blanket?

603
00:28:39,440 --> 00:28:42,036
Why did you call me?

604
00:28:42,070 --> 00:28:43,650
I want to sleep.

605
00:28:44,021 --> 00:28:45,134
Why are you sleeping early?

606
00:28:45,163 --> 00:28:47,301
I’m tired from watching the game.

607
00:28:47,338 --> 00:28:49,300
I’m sleepy.

608
00:28:50,100 --> 00:28:51,774
Actually, I didn’t have anything important to say.

609
00:28:51,796 --> 00:28:54,029
I heard the freshmen are at Bang On,

610
00:28:54,043 --> 00:28:55,112
so I just called to check.

611
00:28:55,149 --> 00:28:58,530
Oh, I’m not going there.

612
00:28:58,552 --> 00:29:01,054
Who would dare go against your orders?

613
00:29:01,083 --> 00:29:03,883
You told me not to go there.

614
00:29:04,370 --> 00:29:08,363
I’m a good and obedient boy.

615
00:29:08,385 --> 00:29:11,207
Where are you, by the way?

616
00:29:18,530 --> 00:29:19,694
Hello?

617
00:29:22,520 --> 00:29:24,072
Hello, Arc?

618
00:29:24,630 --> 00:29:26,247
Hello?

619
00:29:28,465 --> 00:29:29,709
Where are you, Arc?

620
00:29:29,723 --> 00:29:30,974
If you don’t answer, I’m going to sleep.

621
00:29:31,970 --> 00:29:32,967
I’m in your car.

622
00:29:33,580 --> 00:29:34,414
Shit!

623
00:29:37,120 --> 00:29:38,283
What’s up?

624
00:29:38,305 --> 00:29:39,876
What a small dorm this is.

625
00:29:41,040 --> 00:29:42,945
Can we talk nicely?

626
00:29:42,974 --> 00:29:44,734
I have my reasons.

627
00:29:44,770 --> 00:29:46,850
Look, I told you

628
00:29:46,880 --> 00:29:47,963
that if you wanted to come here,

629
00:29:47,985 --> 00:29:49,100
you should’ve called your seniors

630
00:29:49,141 --> 00:29:50,530
or me.

631
00:29:50,567 --> 00:29:52,974
I thought that was a long time ago

632
00:29:53,630 --> 00:29:55,352
and I didn’t want you to worry.

633
00:29:55,381 --> 00:29:57,010
Don’t you think doing this

634
00:29:57,820 --> 00:30:00,203
would make me worry more?

635
00:30:00,232 --> 00:30:00,996
Huh?

636
00:30:02,470 --> 00:30:03,912
I’m sorry.

637
00:30:03,941 --> 00:30:05,476
I won’t do it again.

638
00:30:06,860 --> 00:30:07,876
We can leave now.

639
00:30:07,898 --> 00:30:08,996
I won’t drink anymore.

640
00:30:10,540 --> 00:30:12,298
Hey, you’ve come all this way.

641
00:30:12,327 --> 00:30:13,338
There’s no point in leaving now.

642
00:30:13,367 --> 00:30:15,861
Just go back to drink and leave when you’re drunk.

643
00:30:17,140 --> 00:30:18,661
Huh?

644
00:30:18,996 --> 00:30:20,727
I told you to have someone

645
00:30:20,756 --> 00:30:22,720
look after you when you go out.

646
00:30:22,749 --> 00:30:23,956
I’m here for that.

647
00:30:25,156 --> 00:30:28,370
Are your friends inside the bar?

648
00:30:28,414 --> 00:30:29,680
No.

649
00:30:29,716 --> 00:30:32,349
Then where will you sit?

650
00:30:32,363 --> 00:30:33,440
At your table.

651
00:30:33,469 --> 00:30:36,181
Why? Do any of your friends not like me?

652
00:30:36,203 --> 00:30:37,054
Huh?

653
00:30:38,749 --> 00:30:39,876
No.

654
00:30:41,020 --> 00:30:42,618
BANG ON POCHANA

655
00:30:48,360 --> 00:30:49,905
Do you mind?

656
00:30:52,680 --> 00:30:55,120
I’m so honored to be drinking with my idol.

657
00:30:58,270 --> 00:31:00,450
Since when is he your idol?

658
00:31:03,010 --> 00:31:04,560
I just admire him.

659
00:31:07,980 --> 00:31:09,069
Cheers, again.

660
00:31:11,540 --> 00:31:12,865
Bottoms up!

661
00:31:13,941 --> 00:31:15,360
Cheers!

662
00:31:15,389 --> 00:31:17,207
Let’s go!

663
00:31:29,120 --> 00:31:30,181
Do you mind?

664
00:31:33,770 --> 00:31:34,516
Stop!

665
00:31:35,780 --> 00:31:36,552
This one

666
00:31:38,180 --> 00:31:39,200
is mine.

667
00:31:53,130 --> 00:31:53,781
Stop.

668
00:31:54,650 --> 00:31:57,549
He’s mine.

669
00:32:01,540 --> 00:32:03,360
This one is mine.

670
00:32:03,410 --> 00:32:05,345
Sand, he’s mine.

671
00:32:05,374 --> 00:32:06,429
I know.

672
00:32:06,450 --> 00:32:07,876
You didn’t have to slap me.

673
00:32:08,560 --> 00:32:09,156
Come on!

674
00:32:09,185 --> 00:32:10,429
The bar is not even closed yet.

675
00:32:10,458 --> 00:32:11,556
Yeah, right.

676
00:32:11,592 --> 00:32:12,581
You’re the last one here.

677
00:32:12,610 --> 00:32:14,501
You’re so heavy.

678
00:32:16,250 --> 00:32:18,530
Can’t I go back to drinking?

679
00:32:18,560 --> 00:32:20,283
Look at you.

680
00:32:20,305 --> 00:32:21,345
How are you getting home?

681
00:32:21,381 --> 00:32:22,741
We’ll get a ride.

682
00:32:22,770 --> 00:32:23,650
Don’t worry.

683
00:32:23,672 --> 00:32:24,174
Yeah.

684
00:32:24,203 --> 00:32:27,367
Hey! I’m going with Arc!

685
00:32:27,389 --> 00:32:29,221
Get it together, Arm!

686
00:32:30,540 --> 00:32:31,912
Get it together!

687
00:32:31,934 --> 00:32:33,163
No!

688
00:32:37,060 --> 00:32:38,240
Take a video of him.

689
00:32:38,290 --> 00:32:39,134
I’m definitely filming this as evidence

690
00:32:39,156 --> 00:32:40,341
that I’ve already asked you to come with us.

691
00:32:40,363 --> 00:32:41,723
I’m going with Arc!

692
00:32:41,745 --> 00:32:42,923
Let’s go, Arm!

693
00:32:42,952 --> 00:32:43,992
No, Po!

694
00:32:46,196 --> 00:32:48,872
Hey, is he always like this when he gets drunk?

695
00:32:48,916 --> 00:32:51,098
No, he usually makes a scene

696
00:32:51,120 --> 00:32:53,207
about wanting to go back to the dorm.

697
00:32:53,236 --> 00:32:55,098
If any strangers touch him,

698
00:32:55,127 --> 00:32:56,232
he’ll even punch them.

699
00:32:56,836 --> 00:32:58,254
Well, well.

700
00:32:58,770 --> 00:33:01,883
I guess you’re not a stranger to him anymore.

701
00:33:03,860 --> 00:33:04,938
Really?

702
00:33:05,207 --> 00:33:06,989
If you were really a stranger,

703
00:33:07,003 --> 00:33:08,152
you’d be on the ground by now.

704
00:33:14,560 --> 00:33:16,269
Let me ask you again.

705
00:33:16,283 --> 00:33:17,032
Where do you want to go?

706
00:33:17,061 --> 00:33:18,007
Who do you want to go with?

707
00:33:19,700 --> 00:33:21,280
Arc’s condo!

708
00:33:21,316 --> 00:33:22,356
Arc’s condo!

709
00:33:22,385 --> 00:33:25,396
I’m going with Arc to his condo!

710
00:33:30,330 --> 00:33:31,716
Let’s split up here.

711
00:33:31,740 --> 00:33:32,640
I’ll take it from here.

712
00:33:33,040 --> 00:33:34,210
Please take care of him.

713
00:33:34,240 --> 00:33:35,345
I will.

714
00:33:36,152 --> 00:33:36,821
Look at him.

715
00:33:49,083 --> 00:33:50,450
Did you kidnap me?

716
00:33:50,900 --> 00:33:52,523
Me? Kidnap you?

717
00:33:54,180 --> 00:33:58,269
Last I remember, I was leaving with Po and Sand.

718
00:33:58,298 --> 00:34:00,260
How did I end up here after I finished my shower?

719
00:34:00,560 --> 00:34:01,680
Think carefully.

720
00:34:11,345 --> 00:34:12,058
Where do you want to go?

721
00:34:12,072 --> 00:34:13,018
Who do you want to go with?

722
00:34:13,650 --> 00:34:15,185
Arc’s condo!

723
00:34:15,207 --> 00:34:16,225
Arc’s condo!

724
00:34:16,250 --> 00:34:19,141
I’m going with Arc to his condo!

725
00:34:19,950 --> 00:34:22,698
Whoa.

726
00:34:23,120 --> 00:34:26,654
AI is so advanced these days.

727
00:34:27,200 --> 00:34:28,465
It’s not AI.

728
00:34:28,487 --> 00:34:29,890
Stop talking nonsense and come to bed.

729
00:34:33,010 --> 00:34:35,883
I’ll sleep on the sofa.

730
00:34:36,580 --> 00:34:37,461
Why?

731
00:34:37,483 --> 00:34:39,309
Last time I hurt my head,

732
00:34:39,330 --> 00:34:40,392
so I got to sleep on the bed

733
00:34:40,830 --> 00:34:42,378
This time, I’m fine.

734
00:34:42,407 --> 00:34:43,680
I can sleep on the sofa.

735
00:34:43,709 --> 00:34:44,712
I don’t want to trouble you.

736
00:34:44,741 --> 00:34:46,552
Do you want to come to bed

737
00:34:46,567 --> 00:34:47,978
or do you want to hurt your head again?

738
00:34:48,930 --> 00:34:50,865
Whoa.

739
00:34:53,150 --> 00:34:54,669
I’ll sleep on the bed then.

740
00:35:09,610 --> 00:35:11,141
Are you tired

741
00:35:11,950 --> 00:35:13,629
from following me around and taking care of me?

742
00:35:16,000 --> 00:35:16,894
Yes.

743
00:35:19,636 --> 00:35:21,149
Will you stop doing it then?

744
00:35:21,380 --> 00:35:22,152
Why?

745
00:35:24,450 --> 00:35:25,898
I don’t want you to stop.

746
00:35:28,950 --> 00:35:32,218
Being taken care of by you feels good.

747
00:35:33,860 --> 00:35:34,596
Really?

748
00:35:35,069 --> 00:35:35,883
Yes.

749
00:35:37,880 --> 00:35:39,309
Do you like me at all yet?

750
00:35:52,750 --> 00:35:53,752
Hey.

751
00:35:53,781 --> 00:35:55,112
Fall for me already.

752
00:35:56,570 --> 00:35:58,989
♪ 'Cause you have come ♪

753
00:35:59,003 --> 00:36:03,200
♪ To fill all the missing spaces ♪

754
00:36:03,243 --> 00:36:07,316
♪ My heart no longer has empty places ♪

755
00:36:07,338 --> 00:36:10,516
♪ You showed me love ♪

756
00:36:10,552 --> 00:36:13,192
♪ A love I’d never seen before ♪

757
00:36:15,130 --> 00:36:15,898
Hey.

758
00:36:17,820 --> 00:36:18,960
You’re going to drop me off

759
00:36:18,989 --> 00:36:20,320
at my dorm like last time, right?

760
00:36:20,363 --> 00:36:20,967
No.

761
00:36:21,390 --> 00:36:22,087
What?

762
00:36:22,890 --> 00:36:24,407
Then what am I going to wear?

763
00:36:26,110 --> 00:36:27,272
My jacket.

764
00:36:27,620 --> 00:36:29,309
Are you crazy?

765
00:36:29,330 --> 00:36:31,629
We don’t wear it in the first semester.

766
00:36:31,643 --> 00:36:33,570
If I do, I’ll look so weird.

767
00:36:34,660 --> 00:36:35,709
You’ll be wearing your boyfriend’s.

768
00:36:35,723 --> 00:36:36,625
How is that weird?

769
00:36:39,280 --> 00:36:40,632
We’re not boyfriends yet.

770
00:36:40,661 --> 00:36:41,469
Do you want to be now?

771
00:36:41,483 --> 00:36:42,385
So you can wear it.

772
00:36:44,130 --> 00:36:45,229
No.

773
00:36:47,220 --> 00:36:48,669
Please drop me off at my dorm.

774
00:36:49,090 --> 00:36:51,680
I already had your friends send over your uniform.

775
00:36:51,869 --> 00:36:52,530
Oh?

776
00:36:53,700 --> 00:36:55,163
Then why did you mess with me?

777
00:36:55,930 --> 00:36:57,680
Just in case you said yes to being my boyfriend.

778
00:37:04,060 --> 00:37:05,236
Why are you staring?

779
00:37:05,258 --> 00:37:06,385
Keep eating.

780
00:37:10,930 --> 00:37:12,080
Why aren’t you eating?

781
00:37:19,178 --> 00:37:20,938
Hey, we still have time.

782
00:37:20,950 --> 00:37:21,789
How about we go out for a meal

783
00:37:21,825 --> 00:37:22,650
and then come back for the match?

784
00:37:22,654 --> 00:37:23,578
I’m not hungry.

785
00:37:28,130 --> 00:37:29,243
What’s going on with you two?

786
00:37:29,730 --> 00:37:31,134
See you later at the field.

787
00:37:32,870 --> 00:37:34,552
Yeah, we still have time.

788
00:37:34,581 --> 00:37:35,701
See you later at the field.

789
00:37:38,130 --> 00:37:39,054
Where are they rushing off to?

790
00:37:40,290 --> 00:37:40,792
I have no idea.

791
00:37:40,821 --> 00:37:41,949
I want to rush too.

792
00:37:45,450 --> 00:37:46,581
This is refreshing.

793
00:37:47,120 --> 00:37:49,403
Are you going back to the dorm today?

794
00:37:50,170 --> 00:37:51,003
Stop.

795
00:37:51,520 --> 00:37:53,890
Are you going to tease me until graduation?

796
00:37:54,510 --> 00:37:55,396
I told you I was drunk

797
00:37:55,418 --> 00:37:56,516
and didn’t know what I was saying.

798
00:37:56,552 --> 00:37:57,236
Damn.

799
00:37:57,265 --> 00:37:59,134
That means it’s your instinct.

800
00:37:59,163 --> 00:38:01,512
You must like Arc so much.

801
00:38:01,540 --> 00:38:03,163
Shut up, Sand.

802
00:38:03,192 --> 00:38:04,232
Other people can hear you.

803
00:38:04,590 --> 00:38:07,345
Please. Those matching bracelets

804
00:38:07,360 --> 00:38:08,647
are so obvious.

805
00:38:09,580 --> 00:38:12,283
Everyone in my group has these bracelets.

806
00:38:12,710 --> 00:38:14,087
But Arc didn’t wear it before.

807
00:38:14,116 --> 00:38:15,454
Exactly.

808
00:38:16,410 --> 00:38:17,156
Yeah.

809
00:38:17,178 --> 00:38:18,610
Can I sit with you guys?

810
00:38:19,410 --> 00:38:20,443
Hey, Pond.

811
00:38:20,465 --> 00:38:22,138
Don’t you have to be at the field today?

812
00:38:22,160 --> 00:38:24,443
Oh, I’m hungry,

813
00:38:24,472 --> 00:38:25,774
so I came here to grab something to eat first.

814
00:38:25,803 --> 00:38:27,389
Are you going to watch us today?

815
00:38:28,100 --> 00:38:29,280
Of course, we’re going every day.

816
00:38:29,760 --> 00:38:30,574
Nice.

817
00:38:34,350 --> 00:38:34,945
Aren’t you going to eat?

818
00:38:34,960 --> 00:38:36,552
Oh, yes.

819
00:38:36,920 --> 00:38:37,636
You should eat, Arm.

820
00:38:37,658 --> 00:38:38,421
You’re too small.

821
00:38:38,443 --> 00:38:39,665
You go ahead.

822
00:38:39,687 --> 00:38:40,356
Hey, Pond.

823
00:38:42,350 --> 00:38:43,469
Oh, hey, Arc.

824
00:38:46,060 --> 00:38:47,294
What are you doing here?

825
00:38:48,400 --> 00:38:49,440
Oh.

826
00:38:49,483 --> 00:38:50,770
Pond is here to hit on Sand.

827
00:38:51,767 --> 00:38:53,752
What the hell are you talking about, Po?

828
00:38:54,800 --> 00:38:55,876
What about you, Arc?

829
00:38:56,174 --> 00:38:57,272
I thought you said you weren’t hungry.

830
00:38:59,090 --> 00:39:00,080
Oh.

831
00:39:00,116 --> 00:39:02,530
Arc is here to hit on Arm.

832
00:39:03,360 --> 00:39:04,487
Damn it, Po.

833
00:39:04,516 --> 00:39:05,658
Shut up.

834
00:39:08,900 --> 00:39:10,189
Po, you jerk!

835
00:39:17,440 --> 00:39:19,716
Leave this on for good luck.

836
00:39:19,745 --> 00:39:20,320
Thank you.

837
00:39:20,349 --> 00:39:21,090
Do your best.

838
00:39:21,134 --> 00:39:21,956
I will.

839
00:39:21,992 --> 00:39:22,821
Okay.

840
00:39:22,850 --> 00:39:24,872
He’ll give it his all.

841
00:39:24,909 --> 00:39:25,876
I’m thirsty.

842
00:39:26,420 --> 00:39:27,338
-Me too.
-	You’re thirsty?

843
00:39:27,338 --> 00:39:28,065
Here.

844
00:39:29,610 --> 00:39:30,785
Give it your best shot.

845
00:39:30,814 --> 00:39:31,876
I’m thirsty.

846
00:39:34,490 --> 00:39:35,774
I want to get hurt though

847
00:39:35,803 --> 00:39:37,149
so you’ll be worried about me.

848
00:39:38,820 --> 00:39:39,854
Be serious.

849
00:39:48,840 --> 00:39:50,218
You’re Arc, right?

850
00:39:51,330 --> 00:39:52,574
I’m Brink.

851
00:39:52,610 --> 00:39:54,218
We’re buddies.

852
00:39:54,760 --> 00:39:56,109
This is for you.

853
00:39:59,563 --> 00:40:00,269
Thank you.

854
00:40:00,894 --> 00:40:02,890
Give it your all.

855
00:40:02,916 --> 00:40:04,807
I’ll be cheering for you from the stands.

856
00:40:10,800 --> 00:40:12,021
Hey, Arc.

857
00:40:12,050 --> 00:40:14,407
Your buddy is cute.

858
00:40:14,450 --> 00:40:16,385
Aren’t you going to introduce us?

859
00:40:17,650 --> 00:40:19,047
Let’s go practice.

860
00:40:19,080 --> 00:40:19,985
Let’s warm up.

861
00:40:20,007 --> 00:40:20,538
Alright.

862
00:40:20,552 --> 00:40:21,418
Let’s go.

863
00:40:21,440 --> 00:40:22,741
Go, guys.

864
00:40:23,140 --> 00:40:23,905
Come with us.

865
00:40:23,927 --> 00:40:24,501
Oh, okay.

866
00:40:25,200 --> 00:40:26,218
Go, Arc!

867
00:40:26,225 --> 00:40:26,960
Yes!

868
00:40:30,320 --> 00:40:30,989
Wow.

869
00:40:32,014 --> 00:40:32,901
Wow.

870
00:40:33,540 --> 00:40:34,480
Wow.

871
00:40:35,920 --> 00:40:38,494
Arc’s buddy is really something.

872
00:40:38,530 --> 00:40:39,876
What do you mean?

873
00:40:40,600 --> 00:40:43,360
That’s the campus star.

874
00:40:43,780 --> 00:40:45,578
She’s not only the prettiest in the university,

875
00:40:46,080 --> 00:40:48,298
but also in Chiang Mai.

876
00:40:49,690 --> 00:40:50,494
Really?

877
00:40:50,530 --> 00:40:51,585
Hey, guys!

878
00:40:52,014 --> 00:40:54,010
Hashtag #ArcBrink is trending.

879
00:40:55,620 --> 00:40:57,600
Whoa, they’re trending already?

880
00:40:57,629 --> 00:40:58,400
Yeah.

881
00:40:59,890 --> 00:41:01,912
Oh?

882
00:41:01,941 --> 00:41:03,243
Oh, he’s sad.

883
00:41:03,280 --> 00:41:04,661
Of course, our friend is sad.

884
00:41:04,683 --> 00:41:06,414
What do you mean I’m sad? I’m not!

885
00:41:06,730 --> 00:41:08,392
You’re being defensive.

886
00:41:08,390 --> 00:41:10,232
We can tell from Mars you’re sad.

887
00:41:10,870 --> 00:41:12,050
Don’t try to deny it.

888
00:41:12,072 --> 00:41:13,803
We were going to comfort you.

889
00:41:13,825 --> 00:41:15,432
Let’s see what people are saying about the hashtag.

890
00:41:15,461 --> 00:41:16,552
I’d better leave the sad guy alone.

891
00:41:16,574 --> 00:41:17,214
I don’t like him.

892
00:41:17,250 --> 00:41:18,720
Let him be sad by himself.

893
00:41:18,756 --> 00:41:19,454
Yeah.

894
00:41:19,490 --> 00:41:20,341
We’re cheerful.

895
00:41:20,370 --> 00:41:21,367
We don’t like sad people.

896
00:41:24,080 --> 00:41:26,080
You’re leaving without telling Arc.

897
00:41:26,760 --> 00:41:28,305
Won’t he scold the hell out of you?

898
00:41:30,120 --> 00:41:31,192
I don’t think so.

899
00:41:31,600 --> 00:41:32,560
I’m sleepy.

900
00:41:33,310 --> 00:41:34,530
He should know.

901
00:41:35,400 --> 00:41:37,781
Are you jealous already?

902
00:41:39,030 --> 00:41:39,789
Po.

903
00:41:39,810 --> 00:41:40,465
Yeah?

904
00:41:40,520 --> 00:41:41,760
I’m not jealous.

905
00:41:41,898 --> 00:41:42,952
He said he’s not jealous.

906
00:41:42,981 --> 00:41:44,232
In that case, let’s keep walking.

907
00:41:45,520 --> 00:41:47,040
Arc is so handsome.

908
00:41:47,670 --> 00:41:49,025
You’ll get jealous many more times.

909
00:41:51,410 --> 00:41:54,967
Sand, I said I’m not jealous.

910
00:41:55,156 --> 00:41:56,603
He’s not jealous, okay?

911
00:41:57,170 --> 00:41:57,687
Huh?

912
00:41:57,709 --> 00:41:58,130
Sorry.

913
00:41:58,160 --> 00:41:58,712
Let’s go.

914
00:41:58,734 --> 00:41:59,709
Yeah.

915
00:42:00,060 --> 00:42:01,825
If you’re not jealous, why didn’t you wait for me?

916
00:42:08,610 --> 00:42:11,374
Please excuse us.

917
00:42:11,396 --> 00:42:12,552
We should go.

918
00:42:12,581 --> 00:42:15,352
Please give him Arm a ride, Arc.

919
00:42:15,374 --> 00:42:15,905
Yes.

920
00:42:18,138 --> 00:42:19,425
Let’s go.

921
00:42:35,900 --> 00:42:36,610
Hey.

922
00:42:37,440 --> 00:42:38,756
What’s wrong with you today?

923
00:42:39,880 --> 00:42:40,770
Nothing.

924
00:42:41,230 --> 00:42:42,218
I’m just sleepy.

925
00:42:42,710 --> 00:42:43,854
Give me the truth.

926
00:42:49,110 --> 00:42:50,690
Sand told me

927
00:42:50,720 --> 00:42:53,200
you were looking at the hashtag about me and my buddy,

928
00:42:53,236 --> 00:42:54,400
and then you turned into a sad puppy.

929
00:42:57,120 --> 00:42:58,603
I have a reason to be sad.

930
00:42:59,880 --> 00:43:00,654
Why?

931
00:43:01,150 --> 00:43:03,920
They all want you two to get together.

932
00:43:03,949 --> 00:43:05,287
How can I not be sad about that?

933
00:43:06,530 --> 00:43:10,378
Look, I don’t have to do what they want, do I?

934
00:43:11,760 --> 00:43:12,814
Whatever.

935
00:43:13,338 --> 00:43:14,429
It’s no big deal.

936
00:43:14,450 --> 00:43:16,087
I’m just being silly.

937
00:43:16,123 --> 00:43:17,585
It’s really nothing.

938
00:43:17,912 --> 00:43:18,792
Forget it.

939
00:43:20,570 --> 00:43:21,723
This is good.

940
00:43:23,060 --> 00:43:23,890
What’s good?

941
00:43:24,410 --> 00:43:25,570
You being jealous.

942
00:43:26,300 --> 00:43:27,185
I like it.

943
00:43:29,180 --> 00:43:31,180
I’m not jealous.

944
00:43:31,910 --> 00:43:33,389
I’m just a little upset.

945
00:43:36,890 --> 00:43:37,672
Really?

946
00:43:38,460 --> 00:43:39,876
I like that you’re upset too.

947
00:43:41,050 --> 00:43:42,189
You’re weird.

948
00:43:42,581 --> 00:43:44,305
How is my being upset a good thing?

949
00:43:45,890 --> 00:43:46,945
Of course it is.

950
00:43:46,967 --> 00:43:48,152
It tells me that

951
00:43:48,196 --> 00:43:51,287
you’re starting to feel possessive of me.

952
00:43:51,927 --> 00:43:52,901
Arc.

953
00:43:54,090 --> 00:43:55,047
Am I right?

954
00:43:56,210 --> 00:43:57,272
Well…

955
00:44:01,660 --> 00:44:02,472
Yeah.

956
00:44:03,620 --> 00:44:06,509
Besides looking at the hashtag and getting jealous,

957
00:44:06,530 --> 00:44:08,807
did anything else make you upset today?

958
00:44:09,000 --> 00:44:09,890
No.

959
00:44:10,390 --> 00:44:13,643
You didn’t even take her snacks home,

960
00:44:14,123 --> 00:44:16,120
so there’s no other reason for me to be upset, right?

961
00:44:17,280 --> 00:44:18,072
Okay.

962
00:44:18,923 --> 00:44:20,920
Hey, what are you doing?

963
00:44:26,920 --> 00:44:27,512
Here you go.

964
00:44:29,789 --> 00:44:31,510
SETTING THE RECORD STRAIGHT #ARCARM

965
00:44:31,534 --> 00:44:32,938
What the hell are you doing?

966
00:44:35,345 --> 00:44:36,967
Setting the record straight.

967
00:44:36,989 --> 00:44:37,920
Setting the record straight?

968
00:44:37,963 --> 00:44:38,763
Yeah.

969
00:44:45,880 --> 00:44:46,669
By the way,

970
00:44:47,127 --> 00:44:49,120
have you figured out who your buddy is?

971
00:44:50,780 --> 00:44:51,709
Not yet.

972
00:44:52,020 --> 00:44:55,010
If you find him and he’s more handsome than me,

973
00:44:55,670 --> 00:44:57,178
don’t fall for him, okay?

974
00:44:57,803 --> 00:44:59,672
I can’t promise that.

975
00:44:59,956 --> 00:45:01,112
Arm!

976
00:45:01,149 --> 00:45:02,509
Just kidding.

977
00:45:04,630 --> 00:45:09,818
I still can’t guess who my buddy is.

978
00:45:09,840 --> 00:45:12,603
The hints are so hard.

979
00:45:14,470 --> 00:45:15,861
How hard can they be?

980
00:45:15,905 --> 00:45:16,880
What are the hints?

981
00:45:17,660 --> 00:45:20,712
His name is related to nature.

982
00:45:21,240 --> 00:45:25,614
Something vast and the tallest in the world.

983
00:45:26,100 --> 00:45:27,200
I don’t know what it is.

984
00:45:27,870 --> 00:45:28,734
Do you have any ideas?

985
00:45:28,770 --> 00:45:30,240
What could it be? I don’t know.

986
00:45:31,250 --> 00:45:34,872
Po said the name has something to do with the sky.

987
00:45:34,894 --> 00:45:36,870
Something like that.

988
00:45:38,870 --> 00:45:40,152
It’s Tongfah.

989
00:45:43,460 --> 00:45:44,676
My name is Tongfah.

990
00:45:47,240 --> 00:45:48,574
We’re buddies.

991
00:45:49,869 --> 00:45:50,465
Huh?

992
00:45:59,290 --> 00:46:00,865
How are you getting home today?

993
00:46:00,880 --> 00:46:01,905
He’s coming with me.

994
00:46:01,927 --> 00:46:02,843
Huh?

995
00:46:02,880 --> 00:46:05,563
Why are you so touchy?

996
00:46:05,592 --> 00:46:06,385
Huh?

997
00:46:06,414 --> 00:46:07,854
Because you keep messing with my feelings.

998
00:46:09,360 --> 00:46:11,985
Tongfah really is as cool as everyone says.

999
00:46:12,014 --> 00:46:13,345
You know how to play guitar too?

1000
00:46:13,740 --> 00:46:15,156
I don’t like anyone else looking at you.

1001
00:46:16,100 --> 00:46:17,585
I don’t like you smiling at anyone else.

1002
00:46:18,770 --> 00:46:20,705
I don’t like you going around acting cute.
